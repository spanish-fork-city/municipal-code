    <h3>4.30.140 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Procedure</h3>
    <p>List in order of frequency. Post FAQs on the Engineering & Development Questions and Requests Website.</p>
    <p>GENERAL FAQs</p>
    <p>Construction dust and debris.</p>
    <p>Call (801) 804-4570.</p>
    <p>Water ponding in my backyard.</p>
    <p>After storms or snow melt, ponding in yards is normal until grass or vegetation is established. If water is coming in from neighboring property that is a civil issue that the City does not interfere with.</p>
    <p>I need to dig in my yard.</p>
    <p>Call 811 or visit bluestakes.org to submit a ticket. Blue Stakes will come out and mark where underground utilities are located. Protect the marking during your project and carefully dig when 2 feet using hand tools within 2 feet of the markings.</p>
    <p>Why was the road/my yard/property painted? (Blue Staked).</p>
    <p>Someone has requested that the underground utilities be marked so they can safely dig in the area.</p>
    <p>Can the City survey my property?</p>
    <p>No, property owners must hire a private surveyor. The city has a bidders list of surveyors.</p>
    <p>Who needs an excavation permit?</p>
    <p>Anyone digging from the back of sidewalk into the road or connecting to a city utility. See the Excavation Permit website.</p>
    <p>How can I apply for an excavation permit?</p>
    <p>See the Permit Portal website.</p>
    <p>When do I get my excavation permit deposit refunded?</p>
    <p>Half of the deposit will be released when the project passes final inspection. The remaining funds are retained through a one year warranty period. After it passes the one year inspection the remaining deposit will be released.</p>
    <p>Septic tank questions and permit?</p>
    <p>City Code 13.24.040 Septic Tanks and the Private Disposal of Wastewater requires at least a 5 acre lot and City Engineer approval for new septic tanks. New septic tanks are not allowed in any area where existing City sewer lines are close. Septic tank installation is regulated by Utah County (801) 851-8000.</p>
    <p>Does the City buy or lease water shares? (Also in Water FAQs)</p>
    <p>No. For additional information contact Marlo Smith at (801) 804-4541.</p>
    <p>STORM WATER POLLUTION PREVENTION PROGRAMS (SWPPP) FAQS</p>
    <p>What are the SWPPP requirements?</p>
    <p>See SWPPP Requirements or call (801) 804-4570.</p>
    <p>Storm water is backing up.</p>
    <p>If there is a cover over the storm inlet call (801) 804-4570 otherwise call (801) 804-4440 extension 3.</p>
    <p>TRAFFIC FAQs</p>
    <p>State road and signal issues.</p>
    <p>Major UDOT roads include: 400 N, 100 S (West of Main St), Canyon Rd, Main St, SR-51, and US-6, see map of UDOT roads. Contact UDOT Region 3 at (801) 227-8000.</p>

    <p>Stop sign or yield sign requests.</p>
    <p>See the Traffic Sign or Traffic Signal Request Form. For more information regarding stop signs, check out the Stop Sign Fact Sheet.</p>
    <p>Pedestrian safety concern.</p>
    <p>See the Pedestrian Safety Request Form.</p>
    <p>Speed bumps.</p>
    <p>The city does not allow speed bumps because of the following:</p>
    <p>Negative impact on snow plows.</p>
    <p>Expensive to install, maintain and remove.</p>
    <p>Encourages traffic to re-route to other residential streets.</p>
    <p>Interferes with emergency vehicle response time.</p>
    <p>Vehicle damage.</p>
    <p>Increased noise levels from speeding up after bump.</p>
    <p>Reduced fuel efficiency.</p>
    <p>Why roundabouts?</p>
    <p>Roundabouts are safer and allow traffic to continuously flow through an intersection. See the Roundabout Fact Sheet.</p>
    <p>Where can I find traffic data?</p>
    <p>See UDOT's Traffic Statistics Map and the City Traffic Studies Map for information.</p>
