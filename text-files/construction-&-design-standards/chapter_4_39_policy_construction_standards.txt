Close proximity to a steep slope shall be defined as the horizontal distance from the slope which is less than or equal to the vertical distance from the crest of the slope to the toe of the slope. The geotechnical report shall include sufficient subsurface exploration, laboratory testing and geotechnical engineering analysis to render design level geotechnical recommendations and opinions regarding slope stability and required mitigation to protect planned or future development above and below the slope(s) from earth deformations and other adverse soil or geologic conditions.

All work completed in connection with the site specific geotechnical report shall be performed by an experienced geotechnical engineering firm and under the direct supervision and direction of a professional geotechnical engineer properly licensed in the state of Utah.

The scope of work described below and in Title 15.4.16.170.D is considered the minimum requirement for the geotechnical investigation. The geotechnical firm (Consultant) shall use their experience and engineering judgement in conjunction with the minimum requirement outlined below to develop an appropriate site-specific geotechnical scope of work and report.
Field Explorations.
Prior to commencing field explorations the geotechnical engineer shall review available geologic maps, aerial photographs and other pertinent literature to develop an understanding of the site and its geologic setting.

Locate utilities within areas of explorations by notifying the appropriate local one-call state utility locate service. Independent private utility locates may be required for utilities not identified by the local one-call service. Complete subsurface explorations in accordance with the minimum requirements outlined in this section.


Single residential building lot - complete at lease one (1) soil boring.

Boring(s) shall be located within close proximity to slope crests so as to render a representative soil profile of the slope for analysis. The boring(s) shall extend to a minimum depth of 15 feet below the tow of slope. For example, if a 30-foot tall slope is being evaluated the boring shall extend at least 45 feet below the top of the slope. Borings shall extend through existing fill materials so that at least one sample is collected in native soil. Adjust boring depths for anticipated site development cuts and fills and for known soil conditions.

The geotechnical shall consider past property use and location. Additional soil borings shall be planned for sites located in areas that are known or suspected to have had previous slope deformations or seeps, springs or other adverse features. Special attentions shall be given to identifying, to the extend practical, the presence and extent of existing fill.

Collect a minimum of four (4) soil samples in the upper ten (10) feet of the profile and at intervals of five (5) feet thereafter. Adjust sampling intervals to include major changes in soil layering. Collect a sufficient number of undisturbed samples in fine-grained soils to properly assess strength and consolidation properties. Perform split barrel sampling in granular soils. Field blow counts should be corrected for energy and depth and presented as Standard Penetration Test (SPT) blow counts on the soil boring logs.

Field classify encountered soil in accordance with the American Standard for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and Unified Classification Systems (USCS).

Borings encountering bedrock shall be extended a minimum of 5 feet into the bedrock. Rock coring equipment shall be used where practical to aid in assessing rock properties. Where cores are collected, Rock Quality Designator (RQD) values should be presented on the boring logs.


Laboratory Testing. Samples collected in the field shall be properly packaged to avoid disturbance or freezing and transported to an accredited geotechnical and materials testing laboratory for further observation and testing. Laboratory testing shall be performed under the direction of a Utah licensed professional geotechnical engineer and in accordance with appropriate ASTM standards. At a minimum laboratory testing shall include the following:
Sieve analysis - determine grain size distribution and percent fines (minus 200 sieve)
Atterberg tests - classification, indexing, shrinkage and expansiveness
In-place density
Natural moisture content
Shear strength - Direct Shear and/or Triaxial Shear

Additional laboratory testing may be required to address site conditions and provide necessary engineering properties for analysis. The geotechnical engineer shall use his professional judgement and local experience to determine an appropriate scope for laboratory testing.

Laboratory testing results shall be presented in the Geotechnical Report, on individual summary sheets in the report appendix or on the boring logs.
Geotechnical Report Requirements. The result of the field and laboratory programs shall be evaluated by a Utah registered professional geotechnical engineer. Based on the results of their evaluation, an engineering report shall be prepared that details the results of the testing performed, provides logs of the borings and a diagram of the site/boring layout and provides geotechnical recommendations and information regarding the following:
General suitability of the site for the planned development
Recommend precautions and limitations
Subsurface exploration procedures
Soil and rock conditions encountered
Groundwater depth during and after drilling
Geologic setting
Geologic hazards

Special design and construction provisions for footings or foundations near steep slopes, including type and depth of foundation system and set back distance from slopes
Surface water runoff control and drainage
Subsurface drainage
Site grading and earthwork requirements, as appropriate

Detailed individual boring logs and graphical cross sections summarizing soil/rock profiles and slope stability analysis and results shall be included in the geotechnical report. The logs shall contain sufficient detail to render a clear description of the soil stratigraphy, soil descriptions and classifications, SPT blow counts, sample locations and depths, groundwater depths and appropriate laboratory test results. Individual boring logs shall include a description of the boring location, exploration equipment used, relative or actual elevation, date of exploration and other pertinent information relative to the field exploration. The cross sections shall contain sufficient detail to render a clear description of the slope stability analysis results and any mitigation measures required. The cross sections shall contain soil profile data and a summary of engineering properties and parameters used in the analysis for each significant soil/rock layer.

The final geotechnical report shall bear the geotechnical engineer's stamp and seal. One (1) electronically submitted PDF copy of the report shall be delivered to the City of Spanish Fork within sufficient time for review and comment. The City will have the report reviewed by its own geotechnical engineer. The cost of that review will be borne by the applicant.
Stream Bank Stabilization.
In order to protect future development adjacent to the Spanish Fork River from flooding and natural erosion hazards, all future development that borders the river within the. boundaries of Spanish Fork City shall complete a natural hazards analysis for flooding, erosion, and groundwater hazards. A technical report must be prepared by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Utah, to document that analysis. The analysis and report shall, at a minimum, include the following items:

Pressure tests must meet the requirements and specifications of APWA 33 08 00 (Commissioning of Water Utilities).
Leakage Test.
Leakage tests shall be conducted concurrently with the pressure tests. Leakage shall be defined as the quantity of water that must be supplied into the newly laid pipe, or any valved section thereof, to maintain pressure within 5 psi of the specified test pressure after the air in the pipeline has been expelled and the pipe has been filled with water.

No pipe installation will be accepted if the leakage is greater than that determined by the following formula:

        LD*√P
Q= ----------
       133,200

In which Q is the allowable leakage, in gallons per hour; L is the length of pipeline tested in feet; P is the average test pressure, in pounds per square inch (gage) and D is the nominal diameter of the pipe in inches.

Provide 225 psi test pressure for 2 hours unless specified otherwise. If any test of pipe laid discloses leakage of greater than specified, the Contractor shall, at their own expense, locate and repair the defective material until the leakage is within the specified allowance. All visible leaks are to be repaired regardless of the amount of leakage.
Bacteria Test.
Bacteria tests shall meet the requirements and specifications of APWA 33 13 00 (Disinfection). Tests may only be scheduled at certain regular times set by the City. The Contractor shall be present and open all hydrants or other locations to be tested from. The City shall submit samples to a certified lab to be tested according to state drinking water regulations.

If any sample point fails on the first test, the line will be flushed and re-tested at all sample points. If any sample point fails a second time, the complete line will be re-disinfected and re-tested at all sample points. If any samples come back marked "presence", which means coli form bacteria is present, the line will be re-disinfected and re-tested at all sample sites. Contractor is responsible to pay for all bacteria tests and retests.

Drinking water services on main replacements will not be installed until bacteria sample results have been approved by the City Engineer. All testing lab fees shall be paid for by the Contractor. Services on new subdivisions will be tested at the same time as the main line.

The design guidelines include the design standards and regulations and hydrologic and hydraulic computation methods reference for evaluating and designing storm drain and flood control facilities in Spanish Fork City.




4.39.55.015 Design Standards And Regulations
Low Impact Development.
The MS4 permit for Spanish Fork City requires that new development or redevelopment projects that disturb greater than or equal to one acre, including projects less than one acre that are part of a larger common plan of development or sale to manage rainfall on-site, and prevent the off-site discharge of the precipitation from all rainfall events less than or equal to the 90th percentile rainfall event. Spanish Fork City has elected to change the 90th percentile rainfall event to the 25-year storm event with a duration and intensity that produces the largest storage requirement. A redevelopment project that would require LID is further defined as any project that increases the existing impervious area by 10% or more. The requirement includes the evaluation of a Low Impact Development (LID) approach which encourages the implementation of BMPs that infiltrate, evapotranspire or harvest and use storm water from the site to protect water quality (Small MS4 General Permit No. UTR090000). As Spanish Fork City  continues to develop and redevelop, LID practices will need to be implemented to comply with State and Federal regulations.

LID is a comprehensive approach to micromanaging storm water where it is generated. The goal of LID is to develop a storm water management strategy where post-development hydrologic conditions mimic pre-development conditions through utilizing storm water features that infiltrate and evapotranspire in a cost-effective, flexible manner. It also involves protecting water quality by treating and filtering storm water near the source, before it infiltrates into the ground.

LID practices focus on preventing flooding, erosion, and pollution by utilizing natural processes to filter, treat, and allow storm water to infiltrate into the ground. It typically preserves, restores, and creates green infrastructure using soils and vegetation. By implementing LID principles and practices, water can be managed in a way that reduces negative environmental impacts often associated with developed areas and promotes the natural movement of water within the area.

LID strategies include several techniques to generate less runoff from developed land. LID practice are flexible, offering a wide variety of techniques to reduce runoff timing and volume. LID practices control storm water runoff at the lot level, using a series of integrated strategies that rely on natural processes.

LID principles:
preserve and recreate natural landscape features
minimize directly-connected impervious area
comprehensive, landscape-based approached to sustainable development
utilize natural hydrologic functions and processes
focus on prevention, rather than mitigation
emphasize simple, low-tech, low cost methods
manage storm water runoff as close to the source as possible
minimize disturbance
increase drainage flow paths
utilize onsite filtering and treatment methods
Potential LID Features and Practices.
There are many practices that can be utilized when implementing LID principles. Some are listed below.
Xeriscape Swale/Grassy Swale - A swale landscaped with xeriscape plants or grass can be used to infiltrate storm water in place. Curb cuts along roads can be used to discharge storm water runoff generated in paved streets and parking lots into the swale.
Underground Storage Tanks - Underground storage can include R-tanks, Stormbrixx, StormTech systems, or other underground storage facilities that are designed to detain or retain storm water runoff and allow it to infiltrate into the ground. Underground storage facilities should have an overflow to a centralized storm drain system. Treatment should be included on any underground storage facility. See Section 4.78.12 for treatment criteria.
Rain Barrels - Some runoff can be captured in rain barrels and utilized for non-potable purposes. It is important to keep in mind that in Utah, only 2500 gallons per parcel of rain water runoff is allowed to be collected and stored onsite.
Roof Drains - Roof drains should be connected to grassy/xeriscape areas or underground facilities, such as infiltration trenches or dry wells. Infiltration trenches or dry wells consist of perforated manholes and pipe surrounded by gravel and a geotextile fabric. The purpose of the infiltration trench or dry well is to store water and allow it to percolate into the ground. It is important that the roof runoff be treated prior to infiltrating into the ground.
Grass Filter Strips - Grass Filter Strips are low-angled vegetated slopes that drain away from the parking lot or roadway.
Bioretention - Bioretention includes the use of vegetation and soils to clean storm water runoff in an earthen basin lined with plants and mulch.
Permeable Pavement - Permeable pavement could include grass pavers, paving stones, porous asphalt, or pervious concrete. It can be used on parking stalls, overflow parking, driveways, walkways and plazas.
Soil Amendments - In areas where native soils have low infiltration rates, the native soils can be amended by mixing in organics or other materials to increase infiltration capacity. Soil amendments can also improve water quality, depending on the materials added. It is important that the soil is not compacted during construction.
Preserve Vegetation - The natural vegetation of an area to be developed should be preserved by reducing the total impervious area for a site by clustering buildings close together, reducing building footprints, reducing road widths, and other methods to preserve as much of the native vegetation as is feasible for a given site.
Storm Water Planters - Storm water planters are boxes with drought resistant vegetation that are used to capture storm water runoff from roofs and other impervious surfaces. They function like bioretention on a small scale.

The concepts listed above do not represent all the approaches for implementing LID. Ultimately, the developer and their engineer are responsible to research the most effective methods for implementing LID practices on a development site.

Drainage Plan Report.
As part of the Drainage Plan Report, the following criteria will need to be addressed.
LID Feasibly - All plans for LID facilities will need to be approved by the City prior to design. During the planning process, groundwater levels, percolation rates, source protection zones, and other concerns with subsurface conditions need to be considered. Site conditions such as collapsible soils, low percolation rates, wetlands, and high groundwater levels will limit the types of LID facilities that can be used. We encourage the developer and his engineer to be creative in developing innovative means to implement LID. If the developer believes that LID facilities cannot be utilized on their particular site, documentation will need to be submitted and approved by the City explaining the reasons why LID cannot be utilized. The documentation must illustrate infiltration, evapotranspiration and rainwater harvesting has been used to the maximum extend technically feasible and that full employment of LID facilities are not feasible due to site constraints.
Geotechnical Analysis - Prior to proceeding  with design, soils testing and an associated soils report need to be completed and submitted to the City to document subsurface conditions at each individual site. The geotechnical report must include (at a minimum) percolation rates, groundwater levels, and soil type (including whether the soils are collapsible). The geotechnical report is usually added to the Drainage Report as an appendix. 
Source Protection Zones - Some LID practices may not be appropriate in Zone 1 water source protection areas (Zone 1 Areas) because they require infiltration. Zone 1 Areas are defined as the "area within a 100-foot radius from the wellhead or margin of the collection area." (Utah State Code (R309-600-9)(2)(a)(i)). LID practices may be implemented in Zones 2, 3, and 4 water source protection areas (Zones 2, 3 and 4). However, LID facilities in Zones 2, 3, and 4 may require additional treatment at the discretion of the City. The drinking water source protection areas in Spanish Fork City can be found in the Drinking Water Master Plan.
Design Storm.
LID facilities in the City shall be designed to accommodate, at a minimum, the peak runoff rate and volume generated from a 25-year storm of any duration. Calculations will need to be completed and submitted to the City documenting the design parameters of the LID facilities. All detention shall detain a 25 year 24 hr. storm with a maximum 0.15 cfs per acre release rate. Release rates shall be determined by the City Engineer. All LID retention shall retain and infiltrate a 100 year 24 hr. All LID retention shall have an emergency overflow to a storm drain, collector street, or permanent ditch. 
Depth and Intensity.
Rainfall depth and intensity data shall be obtained from the National Weather Service's Precipitation Frequency Data Server (http://hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/sa/ut_pfds.html). We require each duration between the 5-minute storm and 24-hour storm to be analyzed to determine the peak volume requirement.

Each detention basin shall have an outlet to the City storm drain system. A trash rack shall be installed at the outlet(s) to prevent debris from entering the storm drain system.

Underground LID/Storage.
LID facilities that are designed to infiltrate storm water into the ground may be underground storage facilities. The underground facilities should be designed according to the following criteria:
All onsite LID facilities will be owned and maintained by the property owner, unless the City agrees otherwise. Any LID facilities in the right-of-way will be owned and maintained by Spanish Fork City after construction has been completed and approved by the City. The facilities will need to be designed in a way that allows the City to access and maintain them.
The property owner is required to work with the City's SWMP Administrator to create a Long Term Storm Water Management Plan (LTSMP) and follow its requirements.
Underground facilities will need to be designed to retain a 25-year storm event. They will also need to be designed to drain in less than 48 hours, unless approved by the City. Only infiltration through the bottom of the LID can count towards volume requirement reduction.

The underground storage facility will need to be connected to a storm drain trunkline or a City street as an overflow.

Treatment will need to be included prior to discharging to the underground storage/infiltration facilities. Treatment will need to meet the criteria defined in section 4.78.12.

All underground storage cells shall be wrapped in an approved non-woven filter fabric.

Underground storage and infiltration shall be installed under the bioretention swales as shown in the City standard drawings. R-Tank, StormTech chambers, or approved equivalent shall be used to provide underground storage. R-Tank and StormTech chambers shall be installed per the manufacturers specifications. All underground storage cells shall be wrapped in an approved non-woven filter fabric.

All landscaping in LID areas shall be designed and installed per City standard drawings and specifications.

Downhill cul-de-sacs and dead ends will not be allowed unless specifically approved by the City Engineer.

Special consideration shall be given to downhill 'T' intersections to ensure that flooding will not occur outside of the right-of-way.

Inlets and Outlets.
A concrete apron shall be constructed around inlets to allow sediment to be easily cleaned up.
Storm drain pipe that discharges to an earth-lined channel shall be stabilized to mitigate erosion potential.
Storm drain catch basins or inlets shall generally be located on both sides of the street.
Inlet spacing shall also be designed to meet the design spread requirements from the FHA Urban Drainage Manual as shown in Table 4-1.
As a general rule, inlets shall be installed at intervals not to exceed 500 feet. Inlet spacing shall be addressed during the design phase.

An engineer's recommendations with regard to the lowest elevations(s) that the lowest floor(s) (including basements) of all new and substantially improved structures should be constructed to be protected from flooding from groundwater and groundwater that could be influenced by surface water during periods of flooding..
The lowest finished floor (including basement), shall be elevated a minimum of two feet above the base flood elevation (15.4.20.040 B.1)
All permanent structures shall be set back a minimum of 60 feet from the top of bank of the nearest open channel that conveys runoff water (15.4.20.040 A.2.b).
4.39.55.020 Rainfall-Runoff Computation Methods Reference
Modeling Approach.
There are three acceptable methods for estimating the peak runoff: the Rational Method, TR-55 and HEC-HMS. These three methods are described below. TR-55 and HEC-HMS can also be used to estimate runoff volume for storage facility sizing.

Other methods for estimating peak runoff and runoff volume must first be approved by the City Engineer. The table below indicates the applicable total drainage area for each modeling approach.

Drainage Models and Applicable Total Drainage Area

Drainage Model	Maximum Drainage Area
Rational Method	< 200 Acres
TR-55	< 2000 Acres for Urban Areas
HEC-HMS	Any


Drainage Basin Delineation - For the purposes of estimating storm water runoff, major drainage patterns should be identified based on topography and the location of major natural drainage channels. Within major drainage basins, sub-basins should be delineated for storm water runoff analysis using available local information including, but not limited to:
Topography
Aerial photography
Locations of storm water collection, conveyance, and detention facilities
Lan use and zoning maps
Hydrologic soil maps
Projected Future Land Use Conditions - Impacts that proposed development will have on downstream drainage storm drain facilities shall be evaluated. New development will nearly always increase storm water runoff volume and peak flow. In analyzing the effect of future development, four factors should be evaluated:
Increase in percent of impervious area.
Decrease in sub-basin time of concentration due to local storm drain improvements.
Decrease in runoff routing time due to trunk line and main channel improvements.
Concentration of runoff to discharge points where the undeveloped condition was predominantly shallow sheet flow.

Projected land use for a given area can be obtained from City zoning and planning maps.
Rational Method.
Use the table below to estimate the runoff coefficient.

*Higher values are usually appropriate for steeply sloped areas and longer return periods because infiltration and other losses have a proportionally smaller effect on runoff in these cases.
Time of Concentration - Time of concentration shall be calculated using the method found in SCS Technical Release 55 (SCS, 1986). The minimum allowable time of concentration to be used in runoff calculations shall be 5 minutes.
Rainfall Intensity - Rainfall depth and intensity data is according to the National Weather Service's Precipitation Frequency Data Server (http://hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/sa/ut_pfds.html). We require each duration between  the 5-minute storm and 24-hour storm to be analyzed to determine the peak volume requirement.

TR-55.

The 24-hour SCS Type II storm distribution shall be used if the TR-55 method is used.
The storm depths shall be selected from the depth-duration-frequency curve found on the National Weather Service's Precipitation Frequency Data Server 
(http://hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/sa/ut_pfds.html).

Table 2-2a-d in TR-55 shall be used to estimate the runoff Curve Number.

For urban drainages, pervious and impervious areas shall be modeled as separate sub-basins. Impervious area in small urban areas can be estimated by direct measurements from aerial photography. The method in TR-55, or any similar method, that suggests modeling developed sub-basins using a revising Curve Number based on the percent impervious will not be allowed. Those methods can severely underestimate the runoff potential from a sub-basin.

Typical values of effective percent impervious area based on land use are shown in the table below.

HEC-HMS.
There are four main input categories in HEC-HMS which are: design storm, loss method, transform method and routing method. The design storms shall be obtained using the procedure described below. For the loss, transform and routing methods, there are multiple options within HEC-RAS that can be used. Below is a description of the preferred method. Other methods may be allowed, but must first be approved by the City Engineer.
Design Storm - The design storm shall be developed in accordance with Section 4.78.12.
Loss Method - The SCS Curve Number loss method shall be used. The primary input parameter for this method is the Curve Number. As described below, for developed areas, the percent impervious is also entered. The initial abstraction is typically left blank. The program will calculate the initial abstraction based on the Curve Number using the equation documented in TR-55.
Curve Number - Table 2-2a-d in TR-55 shall be used to estimate the pervious runoff Curve Number (CN).

Soil Classification - In order to estimate the CN, the hydrologic soil group classification for the drainage basin must be determined. The hydrologic soil group shall be obtained from the NRCS SSURGO dataset. SSURGO data can be obtained from the Soil Data Mart (http://soildatamart.nrcs.usda.gov/).

Modeling Impervious Areas - The directly connected impervious area (DCIA) should be entered for developed areas. The DCIA should be measured from aerials for existing developments, or should be obtained from the design plans for a proposed development. Typical values of average percent impervious areas based on land use are included in Table 2-2 of TR-55.

Transform Method - The SCS Unit Hydrograph transform method shall be used. This method requires the input of a single variable: lag time.
Lag Time for Natural Watersheds -  The Corps of Engineers version of Snyder's equation shall be used to calculate the lag time for natural watersheds (USBR, 1989) as shown below:

                                 L * Lca       0.33
Lag Time = Ct (  -----------  )
                                 ( S0.5 )

Where:
Ct= Constant between 1.3 and 2.2. 1.6 is typical for the Spanish Fork area
L= Length, in miles, of the longest watercourse
Lca= Length, in miles, along L to the centroid of the drainage basin
S= Overall drainage basin slope, in feet/mile/

Lag Time of Urban Areas - The lag time for small urban areas is assumed to be equal to the time of concentration. Appendix C contains a sample worksheet from TR-55 that can be used to calculate the time of concentration.

Routing Method - The Muskingum-Cunge method shall be used for routing. The method requires follow parameters are inputted:


Length - Total length of the reach element.
Slope - Average slope for the entire reach.
Invert - Optional. Typically not used.
Cross Section Shape - Multiple cross sections are available to select from. Depending on the cross section chosen, additional information is required (i.e. diameter, side slope).
Manning's "n" - Average value for the entire reach. Typical values for Manning's "n" used for storm drain conveyance facilities area shown in the table below.

Values of Manning's Coefficient (n) for Channels and Pipes

Conduit Material	Manning's n*
Concrete-lined channel	0.013 - 0.020
Excavated or Dredge Channels	

Earth channel - straight and 
uniform	0.020 - 0.030
Earth channel - winding, fairly
uniform	0.025 - 0.040
Rock	0.030 - 0.045
Unmaintained	0.050 - 0.140
Natural Channel	

Fairly regular section	0.030 - 0.070
Irregular section with pools	0.040 - 0.100
Pipe Material	

Plastic pipe	0.011 - 0.015
Steel/cast iron pipe	0.012 - 0.015
Concrete pipe	0.013 - 0.015
Corrugated metal pipe	0.012 - 0.026
*Lower values are usually for well-constructed and maintained (smoother) pipes and channels.

Other Models - Other computer programs can be used to model the rainfall-runoff process that use similar hydrologic modeling methods, but care should be taken to make sure modeling methods are used correctly. The City Engineer must approve all computer programs and methods that are not described above, before they are used.
Calibration.
Peak runoff records are typically not available for local drainage studies. An effort should, however, be made to ensure that rainfall runoff analysis results for local drainage studies are consistent and compatible with the City's Storm Drain Master Plan and other pertinent local drainage studies.

It should be noted that the term "calibration" in this context refers to the process of adjusting parameters to achieve results consistent with available reference information, rather than adjusting for actual stream flow observations from the study area. Multiple hydrologic methods should be evaluated and compared to identify reasonable runoff computation results. These methods may include the Rational Formula, the SCS Curve Number Method, the SCS Pervious CN Method, and the Constant and Initial Lost Method. Regional regression equations may also be used to evaluate results depending on the basin size.
Calibration for Natural Watersheds
Results from hydrologic models should be compared to:
Actual flow records for modeled drainage channels
Stream flow records from hydrologically similar drainages in the vicinity of the study
Regional stream flow data (in the event that stream flow records for the local area are not available)
Calibration for Urban Areas
For small urban (developed) areas, the USGS published regression equations than can be used to "calibrate" hydrologic models (see Peak-flow Characteristics of Small Urban Drainages Along the Wasatch Front, Utah).

The range of basin characteristics used to develop the regression equations are shown in the table below.

                      Range of Basin Characteristics Used To Develop
                     Regression Equations for Small Urban Drainages

Basin Characteristic	Unit	Range in Values
Drainage Area (DA)	mi2	0.085 - 0.87
Basin Slope (BS)	%	0.3 - 15
Effective Impervious Area (EIA)	%	22 - 57

The equations shown in the table below are only applicable to drainage basins that meet the range of values shown above.

100	Q100= 120 DA0.158 BS0.194	29

The unit peak runoff varies depending on slope and the drainage basin percent impervious. In general, the 10-year event for small urban drainages should be between 0.3 cfs/acre and 1.0 cfs/acre. Modification to input parameters should be considered if simulated runoff results are not within this range.

Pavement Design and Soils Investigation.
A pavement design and soils investigation shall be performed for all new roads and those roads for which work will be performed. The results of this investigation and a design of the road cross section shall be submitted to and accepted by the City Engineer. 
Pavement Design Engineer's Responsibility.
The design of pavement sections is a combination of several different and varied factors of civil and geotechnical engineering, which are under the control of the design engineer, not the City. This includes the preparation of an adequate soils report which is representative of soil conditions in the field, at the proper location, both horizontally and vertically, a determination of the types of vehicles which are going to use these roads, the numbers of these types of vehicles, an assumption of the life of the roadway, the equivalent single axle loads (ESALs) the roadways will be subject to, all of which are based in original assumption prepared and made by the design professionals preparing these pavement sections designs. Assumptions and studies made of these initial design parameters are the sole responsibility of the design professional preparing these pavement designs and are not dictated by the City. The design professional is tasked with performing an adequate pavement design and affixes his/her stamp and signature indicating he/she have performed the design, and it is adequate to provide the service life designed for.
Performance Period.
This refers to the period of time that the initial pavement structure will last before it needs rehabilitation. This also refers to the time elapsed as a new pavement structure deteriorates from its initial serviceability to its terminal serviceability. When consultants perform pavement designs for the City, the "Performance Period" will be 20-years from project construction completion.
Pavement Design Process.
The pavement design engineer shall perform pavement designs and evaluations based on the recommendations found in the 1993 version of the "AASHTO Guide for Design of Pavement Structures" and on "UDOT Pavement Design Manual". Alternate design methods may be proposed, provided that the pavement design engineer follows a well-established and proven method. In all designs, the pavement design engineer shall show their work and stamp and sign the recommended pavement designs. This design method will be used in all cases for all classifications of roadways.
Layered Approach - In addition to SN design of the entire section, the minimum required depth of asphalt shall be calculated using the layered approach, which determines asphalt surfacing thickness based on the strength of the base layer immediately below.
Soils/Geotechnical Investigation.
Site evaluations for new pavement design and construction are performed following a defined testing plan that helps identify the necessary conditions to ensure the required information is obtained in the field.
Required Design Information - The following list includes information that is required for pavement design.
Soil types exposed at the ground surface.
Soil conditions within a depth of 3 to 5 feet below the pavement sub-grade including:
Soil classification units
In situ soil moisture content and density
Occurrence of swelling soils
Soil plastic and liquid limits
Moisture-density compaction curves
Occurrence of moisture induced collapsing soils
Depth to groundwater below the pavement sub-grade
Sub-grade support variability
Approximate vertical distance of the pavement surface above or below the adjacent ground surface

Soft or weak soils that will not support or will limit the size of earthwork equipment
Vegetation, debris and other deleterious material that may affect pavement support
Hazard rating for frost damage
Water hazards
Performance of nearby pavements
Design CBR for road sections
Boring/Sample Locations - Location of the borings and samples shall be determined based on the centerline location of the planned road, the planned width of the road and the expected soil conditions for the area. Spacing of the test holes will be controlled by the type and profile of the soil at each location. For long road sections, the City's practice includes using 200 feet as a starting interval for exploration locations and varying this interval up to a maximum of 1000 feet for uniform conditions. If the soil types significantly change between test holes, intermediate locations shall be investigated. The determination of the number and location of samples and/or borings shall consider the reliability of the pavement design and the cost-effectiveness of the investigation. For new developments, with multiple roadways to be constructed, location of borings may be based on a minimum of two borings for each road to be built. Borings, samples, and other explorations shall be located so that the sites can be found during construction. The locations shall be referenced to the following:
A construction station,
Road centerline, and
Elevations or road grades where possible.
Selection of Design CBR - Sub-grade soil CBR values shall be determined using samples compacted at optimum moisture content to 95 percent of the maximum density obtainable by the AASHTO T-180, Method D, of compaction. CBR tests shall be performed according to AASHTO T-193 except that a standard surcharge weight of 10 pounds shall be used for soaking and the penetration test of all samples. The CBR chosen for pavement design purposes shall have a confidence level of 90% for a normal distribution of values. If it is determined that there is an insufficient number of CBR tests, then the lowest CBR value will be used for design. This will be determined by the City Engineer. The following table indicates the number of CBR tests that will provide a 90 percent confidence level that the average test value is within plus or minus 1 unit of the average for a normal t-distribution of values.
