Crack Seal Repair
You will often find the street crews out filling cracks in the roads during the colder months of the year. These are the months that cracks are widest. Crews first clear the cracks of rocks, dirt and debris with high pressure air so please keep parked vehicles and trailers off the side of the road. Keep children away from the hot material during these operations. 

Visit our Streets Maintenance Website for more information.

Avoid Overhead Power Lines
When working on a building or on a ladder outside look up for power lines and stay as far away from them as possible. Do not get closer than 10 feet to any power line. It is best to use wood or fiberglass ladders and carry ladders down by your side, not with the end up.

Do not trim trees around power lines, call or text the City at (801) 804-4550. Do not plant new trees under power lines. If you ever see any downed power line, stay away, keep others away, and call 911.

Make Sure Water to Sprinklers is TURNED OFF
It is recommended that you turn off the water to your sprinkler system at the meter or stop and waste before the city pressurized irrigation (outdoor water) system is energized. See the How To Video on our pressurized irrigation website. Once the outdoor water system is pressurized you can turn on the water and manually test each sprinkler zone. If you have a sprinkler system filter, check to make sure it is clean. Please be sure to securely replace the lid to the box when you are done. To report a leaking or broken valve or handle, call (801) 804-4550 extension 3.

Gutter Clean Up
Please keep the gutters in front of your home clean and try to clear out under driveways that bridge over the gutter. A clean gutter:

-Makes the community look nicer.
-Reduces flooding in rain storms.
-Reduces pollution in our streams.
-Reduces storm drain maintenance costs.

Thank you for all your efforts to make our community a great place to live. Here are some other ways we can avoid polluting our streams and groundwater. 

-Keep household chemicals in doors. 
-Do not dispose of harmful chemicals in the ground, gutters or drain boxes. 
-Avoid flushing household chemicals down the sink or toilet. 
-Sweep/blow fertilizer out of street gutters after fertilizing.

Power Outages
Power outages can be caused by natural events like windstorms, lightning strikes, and heat waves. They may also be caused by transformer or other equipment failure. Over the last decade the City has reduced the number of significant outages by more than half, but it is impossible to eliminate all possibility of an outage.

We encourage all residents to have battery-operated flashlights, alarm clocks, and radios. It is also important to protect electronic equipment like televisions and computers with 1200 Joule or more surge protectors. Please make sure that dust does not accumulate on surge protectors and power strips causing a fire hazard.

Water Conservation
The best way to conserve water is to change how we water our yards.

-Avoid watering during the heat of day and during times of wind. In areas that are windy at night it is better to water during the day. The wind will evaporate water much faster than the sun. Please see the Nighttime Wind Boundary Map on the City website. 
-As the weather changes, adjust your watering schedule accordingly. 
-Aerate your lawn to increase the amount of water the ground soaks in. This is best done in the spring or fall. 
-Water your lawn separately from other landscaped areas. 
-Invest in a smart controller. 
-Place mulch in planting beds to reduce evaporation. This also reduces weeds. 
-Leave small grass clippings on the lawn as a nutrient source. 
-Fertilize lawn in the late fall with a slow release fertilizer. Do not over fertilize. 
-Use hardscape or xeriscape landscaping that requires less water. 
-Plant drought resistant trees and plants. Ask a local nursery about Utah-friendly landscape materials. 
-Control weeds. Weeds use a lot of water. 
-Increase the mowing height of your lawn mower. Longer grass grows deeper roots, uses less water and stands the stresses of hot dry weather better. 
-Clean driveways, patios and decks with a broom or blower instead of a hose.

The following web sites will give you more information on water conservation:

Tips to Save Energy
-Install a programmable thermostat. 
-Use LED light bulbs with the ENERGY STAR label. 
-Air dry dishes instead of using your dishwasher drying cycle. 
-Turn off your computer and monitor when not in use. 
-Plug home electronics, such as TVs and DVD players, into power strips and turn the power strips off when not in use. 
-Lower the thermostat on your hot water heater to 120˚ F. 
-Take short showers instead of baths. 
-Wash only full loads of dishes and clothes. 
-Drive sensibly. Aggressive driving (speeding, rapid acceleration and braking) wastes gasoline. 
-Look for the ENERGY STAR label on home appliances and products.

Gutter Clean Up
Please keep the gutters in front of your home clean and try to clear out under driveways that bridge over the gutter. A clean gutter:

-Makes the community look nicer.
-Reduces flooding in rain storms.
-Reduces pollution in our streams.
-Reduces storm drain maintenance costs.

Thank you for all your efforts to make our community a great place to live. Here are some other ways we can avoid polluting our streams and groundwater. 

-Keep household chemicals indoors. 
-Do not dispose of harmful chemicals in the ground, gutters or drain boxes. 
-Avoid flushing household chemicals down the sink or toilet. 
-Sweep/blow fertilizer out of street gutters after fertilizing.

Outdoor Water Shut Downs Mid-October - Unhook Hoses
Once the system is shut down please be sure to turn off your sprinkler system. This will prevent unintended flooding in the spring.

In order to turn off your sprinkler system, open the green pressurized irrigation box that is located near the sidewalk. Turn the valve in the box perpendicular to the pipe. See how to video. Watch out for black widow spiders.

It is also a good idea to take the time to unhook your hoses from your outside water faucets. This keeps freezing water from bursting the pipes coming from inside your home.

Snowstorm Parking
City ordinance requires that residents not park anything along the street once snow starts accumulating and during snow plow operations for up to 48 hours after a snowstorm. This has the following benefits: 

1) Our streets will be cleared from snow more quickly and thoroughly. 
2) Less incidents of snow plows damaging parked vehicles and trailers. 
3) Safer plowing conditions, especially on steep roads. 
4) Nuisance broken down vehicles and trailers are cleared from the streets regularly.

For more information, visit our Street Snow Removal Website. Vehicles and trailers parked on the side of the road during a snowstorm will be subject to fines.

Garbage and Recycle Cans
Please make sure all garbage cans are out before 7 AM on your assigned collection day no matter when your garbage cans are typically picked up. Routes are constantly changing as the city grows. See the Garbage Truck Routes Map for up-to-date collection day information.

It is important that vehicles or trailers are not blocking cans. Cans must not be filled with dirt, sod, asphalt, burned out charcoal/ashes, or large appliances that make the can too heavy for the garbage truck arm to lift. Make sure lids remain closed so precipitation cannot get into cans, weighing down the garbage and contaminating recycle material.
