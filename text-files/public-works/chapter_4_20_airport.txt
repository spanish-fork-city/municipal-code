4.20.770 Residential Use At The Airport

No owner or tenant may use any property at the airport as a residence, unless otherwise approved by the FAA.




CONSIDERATIONS

Grant Assurance 21: "Airport Sponsors will not permit or enter into any arrangement that results in permission for the owner or tenant of property used as a residence, or zoned for residential use..."
Under Federal law, airport operators that have accepted federal grants and/or those that have obligations contained in property deeds for property transferred under various Federal laws such as the Surplus Property Act generally may use airport property only for aviation-related purposes unless otherwise approved by the FAA. 81 FR 38906.
The Final Policy (II)(e) of the same publication provides, "Hangars may not be used as a residence, with a limited exception for sponsors providing an on-airport residence for a full-time airport manager, watchman, or airport operations staff for remotely located airports. The FAA differentiates between a typical pilot resting facility or aircrew quarters versus a hangar residence or hangar home. The former are designed to be used for overnight and/or resting periods for aircrew, and not as a permanent or even temporary residence." See FAA Order 5190.6B paragraph 20.5(b).
