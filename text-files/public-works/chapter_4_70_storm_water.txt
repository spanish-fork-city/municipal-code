4.70.140 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Procedure

Listed in order of frequency. Post FAQs on the Streets & Storm Water Questions and Requests Website.

What is the storm drain charge on my utility bill for?
Most cities have had to create a storm water utility because of increasing regulation. The costs of this utility is spread out across the city on the utility bills as the storm drain fee.

Is storm water treated?
No, but the City does require pre-treatment of storm water with oil separation, dirt and leaf cleanouts and Low Impact Development (LID). LID is the process of allowing storm water to enter back into the ground as it did before development.

Are the storm water and sewer systems separate?
Yes. Please don't allow contaminants into the storm water system since it overflows to Utah Lake.

Why can't I wash things down the gutter to the storm drain?
Utah Lake is becoming more and more contaminated leading to harmful and unsightly algal blooms.
