4.80.140 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Procedure

Listed in order of frequency. Post FAQs on the Wastewater Questions and Requests Website.

What do I do if I have a sewer back up?
Turn off everything in the house that is using water. If water stops rising, call a plumber, otherwise call the Sewer Department at (801) 804-4443.

Who is responsible for maintaining a sewer lateral?
Residents are responsible to clean their sewer laterals all the way to the main line in the road. If the lateral is damaged the resident is only responsible for the sewer lateral repair from the sidewalk to the home. See Sewer Lateral Exhibit. The City will arrange for all work to be paid for by the City. City will not reimburse residents for any work they have done. Non-residential properties are responsible for everything to the main line. See Title 13.04.030H.

My toilet bubbled up.
This can briefly happen when the City cleans the lines in the street, generally once every 4 years. Please call (801) 804-4443 to report this whenever it happens.

I have sewer smells in my house.
This usually occurs when p-traps dry up. Run water into all the drains of your home to refill the p-traps.

The manhole lid is making loud noises when cars drive over it.
Manhole lids can rock and cause loud noises as they wear down over time. To report a manhole concern, please call (801) 804-4443.

Please see the Sewer Lateral Exhibit.
