4.90.140 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Procedure


4.90.220 Agricultural Pressurized Irrigation Policy

The Public Works Director is hereby authorized to execute the standard agricultural water lease contract, in the format attached hereto, for the delivery of agricultural water through the City’s pressurized irrigation system. The City Engineer may deny connection to the pressurized irrigation system based on modeling results or any findings that may be detrimental to the system.


Only sprinkler or drip irrigation systems may be connected to the City pressurized irrigation system. No flood irrigation shall be allowed from the City pressurized irrigation system.
Applicant shall provide in writing the estimated water use for the upcoming irrigation season by March 15th each year, otherwise the previous year’s amount will be supplied.
Applicant may request an increase at any time in writing as long as the water can be transferred to the City pressurized irrigation system in that water year.
Usage above the leased amount shall be charged at the regular pressurized irrigation rate.
Only Strawberry Water may be leased.
All annual water assessments shall be paid by the Applicant.
No impact fee shall be charged until the property develops.
Agreement shall still apply to any remaining undeveloped agricultural land. Applicant/developer shall bear all costs to move meter once initially installed.
City shall pay for meter and all costs to install service.
City shall own the meter.
The developer shall pay the City a one time setup fee for the farmer according to the table below.

Revised by Resolution 20-05 - March 3, 2020
4.90.380 Fire Hydrant Deficiencies Policy

If development is proposed where there is a deficiency of fire hydrants for existing development, then the current developer will install fire hydrants to solve the existing deficiency and the City will reimburse the developer for materials required to install hydrants that solve the deficiency.

Approved by Administrative Order 01-17 - October 12, 2015


4.90.470 Hydrant Use Procedure
Pressurized Irrigation Hydrants. Water taken from the pressurized irrigation hydrant fill stations at 50 East 400 North, 2500 East Canyon Road, and 200 East 400 South require a permit. These fill stations are clearly labeled “Irrigation Water Fill Stations-Permit Required”. They are only in use during the pressurized irrigation watering season. No other locations are authorized for filling tanks from the City pressurized irrigation system. An unauthorized hydrant use fee, as established in the annual City budget, shall be charged for anyone who uses a hydrant without a permit in hand.

A fee shall be paid with each permit, as established by the annual City budget. Permits shall be valid until the pressurized irrigation watering season is over. A permit must be in possession of any persons operating hydrants at fill stations. Water taken from fill station hydrants may not be used outside of City boundaries unless the water is for a City project or as approved by the Public Works Director.

Fire Hydrants. A permit and meter assembly must be obtained from the City before water may be taken from a fire hydrant. Anyone who operates a fire hydrant must have a permit in hand and be listed on the permit as trained by the City in the safe operation of fire hydrants. An unauthorized hydrant use fee, as established in the annual City budget, shall be charged for anyone who uses a hydrant without a permit in hand.

Permits to use water from fire hydrants will only be granted for specified hydrant(s). Operators authorized by the permit must protect the City water system from contamination by air gap backflow prevention.

Meter assembly may not be left on the fire hydrant overnight. Water taken from fire hydrants may not be used outside of City boundaries unless it is for a City project, or as approved by the Public Works Director.

A fee and deposit shall be paid with each permit. A utility account shall be established for each permittee and the 2 inch water meter base rate and Tier II usage rate shall be billed monthly unless water is used outside the City limits for a non-City project. The usage rate for these permits shall be billed at the non-resident rate.

The repair cost for any damage to the meter assembly or fire hydrant shall be deducted from the deposit. If the deposit is not enough to cover usage and damage, the permit holder shall be liable for and billed for the balance. All fees, rates and deposits shall be established by the annual City budget.

When a fire line enters a building the City will only repair emergency breaks in the line to and including the valve just before it enters the building. If there is no valve before a fire line enters a building, repairs will only be made to within 10 feet of the building.
