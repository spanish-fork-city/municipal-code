5.04.010 Unlawful To Transact Business Without License

It is a Class C misdemeanor for any person to engage in or carry on any business, trade, profession, or calling within the City without first obtaining a business license when required by the ordinances of the City. Each separate business entity is required to have its own business license. A business license does not authorize the license holder to conduct business on City property or facilities. No business may be conducted on City owned property or facilities without entering a lease agreement with the City for that purpose and obtaining a business license.

The type of Site License sought, e.g. Collocation of Small Wireless Facility, Collocation of Large Wireless Facility, installation of a new Utility Pole, or installation of new Wireless Support Structure.  If the Site License is for a Collocation, the application must designate the type of Structure on which the Wireless Facility will be mounted, e.g., existing Utility Pole or Wireless Support Structure, etc. 
The location of the proposed Wireless Facility or Structure, including the designation of the proposed ROW as Permitted or Discretionary. 
A scaled site plan, rendering, or photo simulation, scaled elevation view and other supporting drawings and calculations, showing the location and dimension of all improvements.  The submittal must include sufficient information to determine compliance with the standards and requirements of this Chapter, specifically including information concerning Structure height and location within the ROW, compliance with the City’s intersection and driveway sight distance standards. 
An industry-standard pole load analysis indicating that the Structure on which the Wireless Facilities will be mounted will safely support the load.
The Community Development Department may allow a Provider to maintain on file with the Community Development Department any documentation that would otherwise be required for each individual application, such as basic Wireless Facility design documents and pole load analyses.  The Provider must update any such information as necessary to keep it current. 
If a Provider desires to be exempted from the Site License Fee, the Provider must submit evidence that the Provider is subject to the Municipal Telecommunications License Tax pursuant to Utah Code §10-1-401 et seq. and has a valid franchise agreement with the City as a telecommunications provider. 
The City may require the applicant to submit additional information for any application for a Site License for a Discretionary Use. 
A Provider may submit a consolidated application for the Collocation of up to 25 Small Wireless Facilities, so long as the Small Wireless Facilities are substantially the same type, and proposed for Collocation on substantially the same types of Structures.  A Provider may submit a consolidated application for the installation, modification, or replacement of up to 25 Structures.  In any 30-day period, a Provider may not file more than (i) one consolidated application, or (ii) multiple applications that collectively seek Site Licenses for a combined total of more than 25 Small Wireless Facilities and Structures.
Within 30 days after the date an application is submitted to the City, the City shall determine whether the application is complete, and shall notify the Provider of that determination in writing.  If the City determines that an application is incomplete, the City shall specifically identify the missing information in the written notification.  The processing deadline will be tolled from the date when the City sends the written notification until the date when the Provider submits the missing information.  If the Provider does not submit the missing information within 90 days after the date of the written notification, the application will expire. 
The City shall approve or deny applications in accordance with the following deadlines: 
Applications for the Collocation of Small Wireless Facilities shall be approved or denied within 60 days after the day when the City receives a complete application.  The City may extend the deadline by a single additional period of 10 business days by sending the applicant written notice of the extension before the applicable deadline.

If the City denies an application, the City shall provide the applicant with a written decision that documents the basis for the denial, and shall send that decision to the applicant simultaneously with the denial of the application.  If the City denies an application for one or more Utility Poles, or one or more Small Wireless Facilities in a consolidated application, the City shall not use that denial as a basis to delay the application process for any other Utility Pole or Small Wireless Facility in the same consolidated application. 
Within 30 days after the day on which the City denies an application, the applicant may cure the deficiencies noted in the original denial and resubmit the application without paying another application fee.  The City shall approve or deny the resubmitted application within 30 days of receipt, and shall limit its review to the deficiencies noted in the original denial unless the applicant has changed another portion of the application. 
A site License will expire 120 days after approval if the licensed Small Wireless Facility or Utility Pole is not installed and operational.  The foregoing deadline will be tolled for any period of time during which an event of force majeure prohibits timely completion. 
A denial of a site license application may be appealed to the City Manager by giving written notice to the City Recorder within 15 days of the denial.  A hearing will be scheduled within 45 days of receipt of the notice.  A decision will be rendered within 30 days after the hearing, unless the parties stipulate to a longer time.  The decision of the Manager is final and non-appealable.
