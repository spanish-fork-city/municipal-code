    <p>Access and Right of Entry. Employees or agents of the City shall have the right to enter upon any premises at all reasonable hours for the purpose of reading the demarc boxes and utility meters thereon. All other inspections, for whatever purpose, shall be made in accordance with Spanish Fork Municipal Code §1.08.010.</p>
    <p>Each utility user shall keep each demarc box or meter freely accessible to employees of the City for the purpose of reading said meter and shall not obstruct access to said meter in any manner whatsoever, including but not limited to obstructions or inaccessibility caused by buildings, fences, gates, enclosures, vegetation, any structure of any kind, or by dogs or other animals.</p>
    <p>In addition to any penalty imposed by this Chapter, the City may disconnect the utility service to any user who obstructs or makes inaccessible or who allows to be obstructed or to become inaccessible any demarc box or meter.</p>
    <p>Tree and Vegetation Trimming or Removal. Spanish Fork City has the right to go upon private property where it has easements, either formal or prescriptive, in order to trim or remove trees and other vegetation to keep them from interfering with hydrants, utility boxes, meters, pipelines, power lines, and telecommunication lines. Tree and vegetation trimming does not have the purpose of being aesthetically pleasing, but will be for the purpose of maintaining safe and reliable lines.</p>
    <p>The scope of any trimming or tree removal will be at the sole discretion of the City and will be based upon potential public safety hazard, potential for property damage, and the type of trees or vegetation involved and their propensity for rapid growth. If a tree needs to be removed, the City will advise and work with the property owners, but removal will ultimately be the responsibility of the owner. If the tree or vegetation is in the public right-of-way the City may proceed to remove trees or vegetation. The City may top a tree if a property owner fails to timely remove it.</p>
    <p>The property owner shall be responsible to ensure lines feeding a residence from a transformer, pole, or junction box are properly trimmed by the City or a licensed contractor. Failure to trim will subject the property owner to damages if the growth causes an outage. The property owner shall not be eligible to receive any reimbursement from the City, or its subcontractors or suppliers for damage to the owner’s property due to their failure to trim trees or other vegetation.</p>
    <p>Willful or Malicious Acts and Damage. No person may willfully or maliciously:</p>
    <p>Cut, break, or remove part of any component of a utility system without authorization from the City;</p>

  </section>
  <section id="13_08_030">
    <h3>13.08.030 Net Metering</h3>
    <p>Spanish Fork City allows small customer owned grid connected electric generating systems (net metering) based upon the requirements and standards of this section. The system is limited to a maximum of 25kW. The total energy generated by customer owned systems pursuant to this section shall not exceed five percent (5%) of the average total energy load within the City for the three preceding fiscal years. The total may be extended to 10% with City Council approval. Net metering allows for interconnected non-utility owned electric generation to be connected for parallel operation with the electrical system of Spanish Fork Electric. For net metering systems larger than 25kW refer to Spanish Fork Municipal Code §13.08.040</p>
    <p>Net metering will be allowed to interconnect with Spanish Fork Electric’s electrical distribution system at a service level voltage only after determination by Spanish Fork Electric that such interconnection will not interfere with the operation of the distribution circuit and ensures the safety of the electric utility employees and customers.</p>
    <p>Interconnection Requirements:</p>
    <p>Customer shall comply with all the latest applicable National Electric Code (NEC) requirements [NEC Articles 690 and 705], National Electrical Safety Code (NESC) requirements, State of Utah requirements, building codes, and shall obtain building permit(s) for the equipment installation.</p>
    <p>Meter and transformer or transformer pole serving the Customer-Generator shall be labeled to indicate potential electric current back feed. Spanish Fork Electric will provide and install labels when Customer-Generator’s electric system is approved for interconnection.</p>
    <p>Customer shall provide space for metering equipment and meter base as per Spanish Fork Electric requirements.</p>
    <p>Customer’s over-current device at the service panel shall be marked to indicate power source and connection to Spanish Fork Electric’s distribution system.</p>
    <p>The Customer shall assume the full responsibility for all maintenance of the generator and protective equipment and keeping of records for such maintenance. These records shall be available to Spanish Fork Electric for inspection at all times.</p>
    <p>Customer’s power production control system shall comply with NEC Articles 690 and 705; and applicable and current Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Standards including Standard number 1547 Interconnecting Distributed Resources with Electric Power Systems for parallel operation with Spanish Fork Electric; in particular the following:</p>
    <p>Power output control system shall automatically disconnect from Spanish Fork Electric’s source upon loss of voltage and not reconnect until Spanish Fork Electric’s voltage has been restored for at least five (5) minutes continuously.</p>
    <p>Power output control system shall automatically initiate a disconnection from Spanish Fork Electric source within six (6) cycles if Customer’s voltage falls below 60 Volts rms to ground (nominal 120 V rms base) on any phase.</p>
    <p>Power output control system shall automatically initiate a disconnect from Spanish Fork Electric’s system within two (2) seconds if the voltage rises above 132 Volts rms phase to ground or falls below 104 Volts rms phase to ground (nominal 120 V rms base) on any phase.</p>
    <p>Power output control system shall automatically initiate a disconnection from Spanish Fork Electric’s system within three (3) cycles for any reverse power flow condition.</p>
    <p>Customer shall provide a written description of how the protection devices will achieve compliance with the requirements of this policy as part of the Building Permit Application.</p>
    <p>Customer shall furnish and install on customer’s side of the meter, a UL-approved safety disconnect switch which shall be capable of fully disconnecting the Customer’s generating facility from Spanish Fork Electric’s electric system. The disconnect switch shall be located adjacent to Spanish Fork Electric’s meters and shall be of the visible break type in a metal enclosure which can be secured by a padlock. The disconnect switch shall be accessible to Spanish Fork Electric personnel at all times.</p>
    <p>Additional Metering: For purposes of gathering research data, Spanish Fork Electric may, at its expense, install and operate additional metering and data-gathering devices.</p>
    <p>Solar Photovoltaic Equipment shall be in compliance with Underwriters Laboratories (UL) 1741, Standard for Static Inverters and Charge Controllers for Use in Photovoltaic Systems; UL 1703, Standard for Safety: Flat-Plate Photovoltaic Modules and Panels; and IEEE 1262-1995, Recommended Practice for Qualification of Photovoltaic (PV) Modules; and the solar system shall be installed in compliance with IEEE Standard 929-2000, Recommended Practice for Utility Interface of Photovoltaic Systems.</p>
    <p>Wind turbines shall meet the requirements of Spanish Fork Municipal Code §15.3.24.090(H).</p>
    <p>Safety. All Safety and operating procedures for joint use equipment shall be in compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard 29 CFR 1910.269, the NEC, the NESC, State of Utah rules, City standards, and equipment manufacturer’s safety and operating manuals.</p>
    <p>Guidelines for System Diagrams. A system diagram or schematic must be submitted with a building permit application. The required System Diagram is one of the most important parts of the application for interconnection. The system diagram is used by Spanish Fork Electric during the review and approval process, and again during field testing and meter installation. The diagram is a permanent record copy of the system and is filed with Spanish Fork Electric for reference.</p>
    <p>Discrepancies between the diagram and the actual installation as built are cause for rejection at the final testing and net meter installation.</p>
    <p>The System Diagram can be anything from a One-Line, to a Schematic, to a complete Wiring Diagram that shows every wire and every connection throughout. Any of these are acceptable as long as the minimum key information is included. Spanish Fork Electric has the discretion to reject the diagram submitted and require a specified format. The diagram does not need to be overly complex, but accuracy and clarity are critical. At a minimum, the System Diagram must show how the components of the customer generator system are connected electrically. Additional information, such as equipment part numbers and physical locations, should also be included on the diagram. Some of this additional information may be contained in the application forms as well, but documenting it on the System Diagram provides a single complete reference for the project and speeds the engineering reviews and field work.</p>
    <p>Some systems have more complex requirements for interconnection and will require much more significant design drawings for review and approval.</p>
    <p>The System Diagram should provide the information as described below:</p>
    <p>Generator (PV panels, wind turbine, hydro turbine, etc.) - Include manufacturer, part number, nameplate maximum capacity (kW), and physical location. For modular systems (e.g. PV panels), also include: number of modules, configuration, nameplate maximum capacity of each module, and total nameplate maximum capacity.</p>
    <p>Inverter - Include manufacturer, type or series, part number, serial number, nameplate maximum capacity (kW), output voltage, physical location.</p>
    <p>Disconnect Switch - Include the physical location relative to the Spanish Fork Electric service meter.</p>
    <p>Electrical Service Panel -Include the panel or main breaker size and the position at which the generation is connected. Show all panels (if there are multiple panels or subpanels) even if not directly connected into the generation system.</p>
    <p>Spanish Fork Electric Service Meter - Include existing meter serial number, meter form, and class.</p>
    <p>Other Related Equipment (battery banks, transfer or bypass switches, backup generators, etc.).</p>
    <p>License Approval.</p>
    <p>Each customer desiring to engage in net metering must enter into a net metering license agreement as prepared by Spanish Fork City. The license agreement will contain additional conditions to maintain the integrity and reliability of the Spanish Fork Electric system and/or conditions deemed necessary to maintain the health, safety, and welfare of the residents and employees of the City.</p>
    <p>The license agreement application shall be accompanied by the design or schematic required by this section, together with a filing fee in the amount of $500.00. Adjustments to the amount of the fee may be made by the City Council in the annual budget, or by resolution.</p>
    <p>The license may be revoked for violations of any of the terms of the license agreement or for violation of any of the terms of this Chapter.</p>
    <p>Temporary Connections. This section shall not apply to the temporary generation of electric energy for emergency or standby purposes, except as noted below.</p>
    <p>All emergency or standby generation shall not be interconnected with Spanish Fork Electric’s system at any time. A positive, physical means of transferring and separating loads between normal and alternate sources of supply must be used to prevent inadvertent interconnection.</p>
    <p>All emergency or standby generation shall comply with the provisions of the latest revision of the National Electric Code and National Electrical Safety Code.</p>

    <h3>13.16.120 Violations And Penalties</h3>
    <p>Any person who violates any provision of this Chapter, who violates the provisions of any permit issued pursuant to this Chapter, or who fails or refuses to comply with any lawful communication or notice to abate or take corrective action by the City Engineer or SWMP Administrator, shall be guilty of a Class C Misdemeanor. Each day of violation shall constitute a separate violation.</p>
    <p>Penalties. In addition to any criminal penalties, each violation may also subject the violator to civil penalties of not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) and not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per day for each day of violation.</p>
    <p>Measuring Civil Penalties. In assessing a civil penalty, the City Engineer may consider:</p>
    <p>The harm done to the public health or the environment;</p>
    <p>Whether the civil penalty imposed will be a substantial economic deterrent to the illegal activity;</p>
    <p>The economic benefit gained by the violator;</p>
    <p>The amount of effort put forth by the violator to remedy the violation;</p>
    <p>Any unusual or extraordinary enforcement costs incurred by the City;</p>
    <p>The amount of penalty established by ordinance or resolution for specific categories of violations; and</p>
    <p>Any equities of the situation which outweigh the benefit of imposing any penalty or damage assessment.</p>
    <p>Recovery of Damages and Costs. In addition to the civil penalty outlined above, City may recover:</p>
    <p>All damages proximately caused by the violator to City, which may include any reasonable expenses incurred in investigating violations of and enforcing compliance with this Chapter, or any other actual damages caused by the violation.</p>
    <p>The costs of City’s maintenance of stormwater facilities when the user of such facilities fails to maintain them as required by this Chapter.</p>
    <p>Legal Action. The City may bring legal action to enjoin the continuing violation of this Chapter, and the existence of any other remedy, at law or equity, shall be no defense to any such actions. The City is entitled to recover its attorney’s fees incurred in enforcing the provisions of this Chapter.</p>
    <p>Remedies Cumulative. The remedies set forth in this Section shall be cumulative, not exclusive, and it shall not be a defense to any action, civil or criminal, that one or more of the remedies set forth herein has been sought or granted.</p>
    <p>Civil Fine Pass-through Recovery. In the event that a non-domestic user discharges water into the MS4 which causes the City to violate any conditions of its state or federal stormwater discharge obligations and the City is fined by the State of Utah or EPA for such violations, then such non-domestic user shall be fully liable for the total amount of the fines and civil penalties assessed against the City, together with all administrative costs incurred, including attorney’s fees.</p>
    <p>Appeals. Any person aggrieved by the imposition of a civil penalty or damage assessment as provided by this Chapter may appeal said penalty or damage assessment to the City Council. Notice of appeal must be filed with the City Recorder within 10 days of receipt of notice of the civil penalty or damage assessment. A hearing with the City Council will be scheduled within 30 days of the receipt of the notice of appeal by the City Recorder. The decision of the City Council shall be final and non-appealable.</p>

    <h3>13.16.130 Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP)</h3>
    <p>Developing a SWPPP is required by the UPDES before an NOI permit is obtained. A SWPPP is one of the most important requirements of the permit. A SWPPP should be kept at the site, and updated as need to reflect the current SWPPP activities on the site. Said SWPPP must be approved by the City SWMP Administrator or a Storm Water Consultant hired by Spanish Fork City to perform such actions. The SWPPP must abide by all items mentioned in §4.2.4 of the State Small MS4 UPDES Permit.</p>
    <p>Developers or Construction Operators must obtain and maintain Notice of Intent (NOI) coverage under the current Utah Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (UPDES) Storm Water General Permit for construction, or an individual permit. The permit must be kept current for the duration of the project. The NOI permit requires construction control provisions as described in §13.16.060, to affirmatively apply, at a minimum, to all construction sites that disturb equal to or larger than one acre, or disturb less than one acre but are part of a common plan of development.</p>
    <p>Developers or Construction Operators must maintain a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) approved by the City SWMP Administrator. The SWPPP must be kept current and maintained for the duration of the project. SWPPP compliance, at a minimum, must include provisions related to, among other things, the following items:</p>
    <p>Assemble a storm water team;</p>
    <p>Describe the nature of the construction activities;</p>
    <p>Document information for emergency-related projects;</p>
    <p>Describe the sequence and estimated dates of construction activities;</p>
    <p>Include a site map;</p>
    <p>List construction-site pollutants;</p>
    <p>Identify all non-storm water discharges;</p>
    <p>Provide buffer documentation, if applicable;</p>
    <p>Describe storm water control measures;</p>
    <p>Describe pollution-prevention procedures;</p>
    <p>Describe procedures for inspection, maintenance, and corrective action;</p>
    <p>Document staff training; and SWPPP certification</p>
    <p>Non-Compliance. Sites that become non-compliant with their SWPPP may receive enforcement, violations and penalties as stated in §13.16.110 and 13.16.120.</p>
    <p>Spanish Fork City uses the State provided Construction General Permit (CGP) or Common Plan of Development (CPoD) SWPPP templates. When creating your SWPPP, BMP’s must be implemented. The BMP’s must be described in detail in the appendices stated in the State SWPPP templates. The CPOD SWPPP template provides a list of sources that provide BMP details to include in your SWPPP. Spanish Fork City also has a BMP manual with detailed BMP’s that can be included in your SWPPP.</p>

    <h3>13.16.140 Long Term Storm Water Management Plan (LTSMP)</h3>
    <p>A Long Term Storm Water Management Plan (LTSMP) or Post-Construction Control ordinances are designed to ensure that the storm water runoff associated with new development to mirror the pre-development storm water runoff of the previously undeveloped site or to improve the storm water runoff of a redeveloped site and reduce the discharge of storm water to the MS4.</p>
    <p>A LTSMP is required at commercial properties developed after 2015, new developments, redeveloped sites, and for any site that the City Engineer or City SWMP Administrator requires.</p>
    <p>A Maintenance Agreement is a mandatory document for sites required to implement an LTSMP. The maintenance agreement must be agreed upon and signed to legally bind the Property Owner and Spanish Fork City to the agreement. The document will last for the existence of the current established development of such property, beginning once both Property Owner and Spanish Fork City sign the agreement.</p>
    <p>Sites required to maintain an LTSMP must address Best Management Practices (BMP’s), both structural and non-structural, that will be used to reduce pollutants and mitigate discharge to the MS4.</p>
    <p>Non-Structural BMP’s are required to be used that address the pollutants that the owner/operator knows will enter or is susceptible to enter the MS4. Such pollutants must be listed in the LTSMP.</p>
    <p>The City SWMP Administrator must inspect permanent structural BMP’s at least once, or as necessary during installation of said BMP’s.</p>
    <p>Inspection Process</p>
    <p>Both the owner/operator and City must perform inspections on a monthly scheduled basis, and as needed. High risk sites may require inspection more frequently.</p>
    <p>The maintenance agreement must be kept current, particularly for the owner/operator of the site.</p>
    <p>Spanish Fork City holds the right to conduct oversight inspection of any BMP’s as frequently as the City determines necessary for each individual site.</p>
    <p>Account for any transfers in leases and/or deeds.</p>
    <p>The city holds the right to perform maintenance or correct neglected MTSMP items at the owner/operator’s expense.</p>
    <p>An annual maintenance and inspection report are required by the owner/operator. This must be documented no later than the end of January of each new year.</p>
    <p>Access for City inspections at least once every 5 years, or more frequently, to ensure the owner/operator has been performing adequate maintenance and that BMP’s are working.</p>
    <p>Non-Compliance. Sites that become non-compliant with their LTSMP will receive enforcement, violations and penalties as set forth in §13.16.110 and 13.16.120.</p>

    <p>Spanish Fork City has the right to go upon private property where it has easements, either formal or prescriptive, in order to trim trees and other vegetation to keep them from interfering with the telecommunications cabling. Tree and vegetation trimming does not have the purpose of being aesthetically pleasing, but will be for the purpose of maintaining safe and reliable lines. The scope of any trimming will be at the sole discretion of SFCN, and will be based upon equipment and facilities present, and the type of trees or vegetation involved and their propensity for rapid growth. If a tree should need to be removed, the City will still advise and work with the property owners, but removal will ultimately be the responsibility of the owner, unless the tree or vegetation is in the public right-of-way. In such an event the City will decide and may proceed to remove a tree or vegetation. The City may top a tree if a property owner fails to timely remove it.</p>

This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the User.</p>
    <p>2. Within five (5) days following such discharge, the User shall, unless waived by the Wastewater Division Manager, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the User to prevent similar future occurrences.  Such notification shall not relieve the User of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which might be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the User of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this Chapter.</p>
    <p>3.  A notice shall be permanently posted on the User’s bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of a discharge described in paragraph 1, above.  Employers shall ensure that all employees, who could cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure.</p>
    <p>4. Significant Industrial Users are required to notify the Wastewater Division Manager immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for a Slug Discharge.</p>
    <p>G. Reports from Unpermitted Users</p>
    <p>All Users not required to obtain an individual wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the Wastewater Division Manager as the Wastewater Division Manager may require.</p>
    <p>H. Notice of Violation/Repeat Sampling and Reporting</p>
    <p>If sampling performed by a User indicates a violation, the User must notify the Wastewater Division Manager within twenty four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation. The User shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the Wastewater Division Manager within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the violation. Resampling by the Industrial User is not required if the City performs sampling at the User’s facility at least once a month, or if the City performs sampling at the User between the time when the initial sampling was conducted and the time when the User or the City receives the results of this sampling, or if the City has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the Industrial User.  If the City performs the sampling and analysis and a violation occurs, in lieu of the User performing the sampling and analysis, then the City will perform the repeat sampling and analysis unless it notifies the User of the violation and requires the User to perform the repeat sampling and analysis.</p>
    <p>I. Notification of the Discharge of Hazardous Waste</p>
    <p>A User must obtain approval from the Wastewater Division Manager at least thirty (30) days prior to discharging Hazardous Waste. If approved, the User must notify the Wastewater Division Manager within twenty four (24) hours prior to commencement of the discharge.</p>
    <p>1. Any User who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and State hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the User discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the User:</p>
    <p>a. An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes;</p>
    <p>b. An estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month; and</p>
    <p>c. An estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months.</p>
    <p>2. All notifications must take place no later than one hundred and eighty (180) days after the discharge commences.  Any notification under this paragraph needs to be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under Section 13.24.060(E) of this Chapter.  The notification requirement in this Section does not apply to pollutants already reported by Users subject to categorical Pretreatment Standards under the self monitoring requirements of Sections 13.24.060(A), 13.24.060(C), and 13.24.060(D) of this Chapter.</p>
    <p>3. Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraph 1, above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen (15) kilograms of  hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e).  Discharge of more than fifteen (15) kilograms of non acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one time notification. Subsequent months during which the User discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification.</p>
    <p>4. In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the User must notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and State hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within ninety (90) days of the effective date of such regulations.</p>
    <p>5. In the case of any notification made under this Section, the User shall certify that it  has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical.</p>
    <p>6. This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this Chapter, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable Federal or State law.</p>
    <p>J. Analytical Requirements Constant</p>
    <p>1. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application, report, permit or other requirement by this Chapter shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard.  If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the the Wastewater Division Manager or other parties approved by EPA.</p>
    <p>2. All laboratory samples collected for this Chapter shall be analyzed by a laboratory that is NELAP (National Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Program) certified by a recognized Accreditation Body, such as the Utah Environmental Laboratory Certification Program or approved by the Wastewater Division Manager.</p>
    <p>K. Sample Collection</p>
    <p>Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report, based on data that is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period.</p>
    <p>1. Except as indicated in Section 2 and 3 below, the User must collect wastewater samples using 24 hour flow proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the Wastewater Division Manager. Where time proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the City, the samples must be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24 hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides, the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the City, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with Instantaneous Limits.</p>
    <p>2.  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques.</p>
    <p>3. For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports required in Section 13.24.060(A) and 13.24.060(C), a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the Wastewater Division Manager may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by paragraphs Section 13.24.060(D), the Industrial User is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with applicable Pretreatment Standards and Requirements.</p>
    <p>L. Date of Receipt of Reports</p>
    <p>Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports, which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern.</p>
    <p>M. Recordkeeping</p>
    <p>1. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this Chapter shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying:</p>
    <p>a. All records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this Chapter;</p>
    <p>b. Any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the User independent of such requirements; and</p>
    <p>2. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses.</p>
    <p>3. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three (3) years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the User or the City, or where the User has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the Wastewater Division Manager.</p>
    <p>N. Certification Statements</p>
    <p>1. Certification of Permit Applications and User Reports. The following certification statement is required to be signed and submitted by Users submitting permit applications in accordance with Section 13.24.040(F); Users submitting baseline monitoring reports under Section 13.24.060(A)(2)(e); Users submitting reports on compliance with the categorical Pretreatment Standard deadlines under Section 13.24.060(C); Users submitting periodic compliance reports required by Section 13.24.060(D)(1-4). The following certification statement must be signed by an Authorized Representative as defined in Section 13.24.010(C)(3): I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted.  Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete.  I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and/or imprisonment for knowing violations.</p>

    <h3>13.24.100 Notification Requirements For Hazardous Waste</h3>
    <p>Notification of Violation. When the Wastewater Division Manager finds that a User has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, an order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, the Wastewater Division Manager may serve upon that User a written Notice of Violation.  Within ten (10) days of the receipt of such notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the User to the Wastewater Division Manager. Submission of such a plan in no way relieves the User of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the Notice of Violation. Nothing in this Section shall limit the authority of the Wastewater Division Manager to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a Notice of Violation.</p>
    <p>Consent Orders. The Wastewater Division Manager may enter into Consent Orders, assurances of compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any User responsible for noncompliance. Such documents shall include specific action to be taken by the User to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document.  Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to Sections 13.24.100(D) and 13.24.100(E) of this Chapter and shall be judicially enforceable.</p>
    <p>Show Cause Hearing. The Wastewater Division Manager may order a User which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, an order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, to appear before the Wastewater Division Manager and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the User specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the User show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing.  Such notice may be served on any Authorized Representative of the User as defined in Section 13.24.010(C)(3) and required by Section 13.24.040(F)(1).  A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User.</p>
    <p>Compliance Orders.  When the Wastewater Division Manager finds that a User has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, an order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, the Wastewater Division Manager may issue an order to the User responsible for the discharge directing that the User come into compliance within a specified time.  If the User does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated.  Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer.  A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the User of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation.  Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User.</p>
    <p>Cease and Desist Orders. When the Wastewater Division Manager finds that a User has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, an order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, or that the User’s past violations are likely to recur, the Wastewater Division Manager may issue an order to the User directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the User to:</p>
    <p>Immediately comply with all requirements; and</p>
    <p>Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.  Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User.</p>
    <p>Emergency Suspensions.</p>
    <p>The Wastewater Division Manager may immediately suspend a User’s discharge, after informal notice to the User, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge, which reasonably appears to present, or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons.  The Wastewater Division Manager may also immediately suspend a User’s discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment.</p>
    <p>Any User notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution.  In the event of a User’s failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Wastewater Division Manager may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals.  The Wastewater Division Manager may allow the User to recommence its discharge when the User has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Wastewater Division Manager that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in Section 13.24.100(G) of this Chapter are initiated against the User.</p>
    <p>A User that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the Wastewater Division Manager prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under Sections 13.24.100(C) or 13.24.100(G) of this Chapter.</p>
    <p>Nothing in this Section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any Emergency Suspension of a permit and/or discharge to the POTW.</p>
    <p>Termination of Discharge. In addition to the provisions in Section 13.24.050(E) of this Chapter, any User who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination:</p>
    <p>Violation of individual wastewater discharge permit conditions;</p>
    <p>Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge;</p>
    <p>Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;</p>
    <p>Refusal of access to the User’s premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or</p>
    <p>Violation of the Pretreatment Standards in Section 13.24.020 of this Chapter.</p>
    <p>Such User will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under Section 13.24.100(C) of this Chapter why the proposed action should not be taken.  Exercise of this option by the Wastewater Division Manager shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User.</p>

    <h3>13.24.110 Judicial Enforcement Remedies</h3>
    <p>Injunctive Relief. When the Wastewater Division Manager finds that a User has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, an order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, the Wastewater Division Manager may petition the Court through the City Attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the individual wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this Chapter on activities of the User.  The Wastewater Division Manager may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the User to conduct environmental remediation.  A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a User.</p>
    <p>Civil Penalties.</p>
    <p>1. A User who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, an order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement shall be liable to the City for a maximum civil penalty of $10,000 per violation, per day.  In the case of a monthly or other long term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation.</p>
    <p>2. The Wastewater Division Manager may recover reasonable attorneys’ fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the City.</p>
    <p>3. In determining the amount of civil liability, the Court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the User’s violation, corrective actions by the User, the compliance history of the User, and any other factor as justice requires.</p>
    <p>4. Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a User.</p>
    <p>C. Criminal Prosecution</p>
    <p>1. A User who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this Chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, an order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than $25,000 per violation, per day, and/or imprisonment for not more than one (1) year, or both.</p>
    <p>2. A User who willfully or negligently introduces any substance into the POTW which  causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty of not more than $25,000 per violation, per day, and/or be subject to imprisonment for not more than one (1) year, or both. This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for personal injury or property damage available under State law.</p>
    <p>3. A User who knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this Chapter, individual wastewater discharge permit, an order issued hereunder, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this Chapter shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than $25,000 per violation, per day, and/or imprisonment for not more than one (1) year, or both.</p>
    <p>4. In the event of a second conviction, a User shall be punished by a fine of not more than $50,000 per violation, per day, and/or imprisonment for not more than one (1) years, or both.</p>
    <p>D. Remedies Nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this Chapter are not exclusive. The Wastewater Division Manager may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant User.  Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the City’s enforcement response plan.  However, the Wastewater Division Manager may take other action against any User when the circumstances warrant.  Further, the Wastewater Division Manager is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant User.</p>

    <h3>13.24.120 Affirmative Defenses To Discharge Violations</h3>
    <p>Upset</p>
    <p>For the purposes of this Section, upset means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical Pretreatment Standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the User.  An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation.</p>
    <p>An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical Pretreatment Standards if the requirements of paragraph 3, below, are met.</p>
    <p>A User who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:</p>
    <p>An upset occurred and the User can identify the cause(s) of the upset;</p>
    <p>The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and</p>
    <p>The User has submitted the following information to the Wastewater Division Manager within twenty four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset [if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five (5) days]:</p>
    <p>A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance</p>
    <p>The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and</p>
    <p>Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.</p>
    <p>In any enforcement proceeding, the User seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.</p>
    <p>Users shall have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical Pretreatment Standards.</p>
    <p>Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical Pretreatment Standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided.  This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.</p>
    <p>Bypass</p>
    <p>For the purposes of this Section,</p>
    <p>Bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a User’s treatment facility.</p>
    <p>Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass.  Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.</p>
    <p>A User may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause Pretreatment Standards or Requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation.  These bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Section.</p>
    <p>Bypass Notifications</p>
    <p>If a User knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the Wastewater Division Manager, at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass, if possible.</p>
    <p>A User shall submit oral notice to the Wastewater Division Manager of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable Pretreatment Standards within twenty four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass.  A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time the User becomes aware of the bypass.  The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The Wastewater Division Manager may waive the written report on a case by case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty four (24) hours.</p>
    <p>Bypass</p>
    <p>Bypass is prohibited, and the Wastewater Division Manager may take an enforcement action against a User for a bypass, unless</p>
    <p>Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage;</p>
    <p>There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and</p>
    <p>The User submitted notices as required under paragraph 3 of this section.</p>
    <p>The Wastewater Division Manager may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the Wastewater Division Manager determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in paragraph 4.(a) of this Section.</p>

    <h3>13.24.150 Repealed 07-16-2024 Industrial Pretreatment</h3>
    <p>Flow-Equalizing Facilities. The Wastewater Division Manager may require any person discharging into the POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable storage and flow control facility to ensure equalization of flow. An individual wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.</p>
    <p>Dilution. No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable Pretreatment Standard or requirement. The Wastewater Division Manager may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable Pretreatment Standards, or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.</p>
    <p>Meters. When required by the Wastewater Division Manager, the owner(s) of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable structure together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the wastes. Such structures, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the Wastewater Division Manager. The structure shall be installed by the owner at owner's expense and shall be maintained by owner so as to be safe and accessible at all times.</p>
    <p>Separate Systems. The Wastewater Division Manager may require the use of separate systems to handle sanitary and commercial or industrial wastewater for sampling purposes, or such that in the event that the user's wastewater is or could cause an interference or a potential interference with the POTW, that the discharge could be separated, preventing discharge to the POTW and still allow the user's sanitary wastewater to discharge to the POTW.</p>
    <p>Grease, Oil and Sand Interceptors. Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the Wastewater Division Manager, they are necessary for the proper handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil, or sand; except that such interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All interception units shall be of a type and capacity approved by the Wastewater Division Manager and shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. In the maintaining of these interceptors, the owner(s) shall be responsible for the proper removal and disposal by appropriate means of the captivated material and shall maintain records of the dates and means of disposal which are subject to review by the Wastewater Division Manager. Any removal and hauling of the collected materials not performed by owner(s) or his/her/their personnel must be performed by currently licensed waste disposal firms.</p>

    <h3>13.24.160 Repealed 07-16-2024Industrial User Compliance Assurance</h3>
    <p>The Wastewater Division Manager may require a user of industrial sewer services to provide information needed to determine compliance with this Chapter. The required information may include:</p>
    <p>Wastewater discharge peak rate and volume over a specific time period;</p>
    <p>Chemical analyses of wastewaters;</p>
    <p>Information on raw materials, processes, and products affecting wastewater volume and quality;</p>
    <p>Quantity and disposition of specific liquid, sludge, oil, solvent, or other materials important to sewer use control;</p>
    <p>A plot plan of sewers on the user's property showing sewer and pretreatment facility location;</p>
    <p>Details of wastewater pretreatment facilities;</p>
    <p>Details of systems to prevent and control the losses of materials through spills to the POTW.</p>
    <p>Such information may be obtained by reports, site visits, questionnaires, permit applications, monitoring programs and the copying of user records.</p>
    <p>Final Compliance Report. Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical Pretreatment Standards, or in the case of a New Source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any User subject to such Pretreatment Standards and Requirements shall submit to the Wastewater Division Manager a report containing the information described in §§13.24.110(A)(6), 13.24.110(A)(7), and 13.24.110(E)(2)(b) of this Chapter. For Users subject to categorical Pretreatment Standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the User’s actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with §13.24.120(G) of this ordinance. All sampling will be done in conformance with §13.24.170.</p>
    <p>Periodic Compliance Reports. All permitted Significant Industrial Users must, at a frequency determined by the Wastewater Division Manager submit no less than twice per year (June and December) reports indicating the nature, concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by Pretreatment Standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. In cases where the Pretreatment Standard requires compliance with a Best Management Practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the User must submit documentation required by the Wastewater Division Manager or the Pretreatment Standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the User. All reports, applications, and/or submissions required by this Chapter shall be signed and certified, as outlined in §13.24.120(G), by the permittee or an authorized representative of the user.</p>
    <p>The Wastewater Division Manager may authorize an industrial user subject to a Categorical Pretreatment Standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated by a Categorical Pretreatment Standard if the user has demonstrated through sampling and other technical factors that the pollutant is neither present nor expected to be present in the discharge or is present only at background levels from intake water and without any increase in the pollutant due to activities of the industrial user. This authorization is subject to the following conditions:</p>
    <p>The waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is determined to be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility provided that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable Categorical Pretreatment Standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater.</p>
    <p>The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the effective period of the individual wastewater discharge permit, but in no case longer than five years. The user must submit a new request for the waiver before the waiver can be granted for each subsequent individual wastewater discharge permit. See §§13.24.110 and 13.24.120(A)(8).</p>
    <p>In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the industrial user must provide data from at least one sampling of the facility’s process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is representative of all wastewater from all processes.</p>
    <p>The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed by the Authorized Representative and include the certification statement referred to in §13.24.120(G).</p>
    <p>Non-detectable sample results may be used only as a demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from 40 CFR Part 136 with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in the analysis.</p>
    <p>Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the Wastewater Division Manager must be included as a condition of the user’s permit. The reasons supporting the waiver and any information submitted by the user in its request for the waiver must be maintained by the Wastewater Division Manager for three years after the expiration of the waiver.</p>
    <p>Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the user’s permit by the Wastewater Division Manager, the industrial user must certify on each report with the statement in §13.24.120(H) that there has been no increase in the pollutant in its wastewater due to activities of the industrial user.</p>
    <p>In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is expected to be present because of changes that occur in the User’s operations, the User must immediately: Comply with the monitoring requirements of §13.24.160(B), or other more frequent monitoring requirements imposed by the Wastewater Division Manager and notify the Wastewater Division Manager.</p>
    <p>This provision does not supersede certification processes and requirements established in categorical Pretreatment Standards, except as otherwise specified in the categorical Pretreatment Standard.</p>
    <p>The City may reduce the requirement for periodic compliance reports, based on Paragraph B above, to a requirement to report no less frequently than once a year, unless required more frequently in the Pretreatment Standard or by the Approval Authority, where the Industrial User’s total categorical wastewater flow does not exceed any of the following:</p>
    <p>Six hundred (600) gallons per day;</p>
    <p>0.9 pounds of biochemical oxygen demand per day; and</p>
    <p>0.01 percent of the maximum allowable headworks loading for any pollutant listed in the Spanish Fork City WRF Pretreatment Program Local Limit Development Document.</p>
    <p>Reduced reporting is not available to Industrial Users that have in the last two years been in Significant Noncompliance, as defined in this Chapter. In addition, reduced reporting is not available to an Industrial User with daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that, in the opinion of the Wastewater Division Manager, decreasing the reporting requirement for this Industrial User would result in data that are not representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period.</p>
    <p>Monitoring Facilities. All wastewater samples must be representative of the User’s discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a User to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the User to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge..</p>
    <p>Right of Entry. The Wastewater Division Manager or designee shall have the right to enter the premises of any User to determine whether the User is complying with all requirements of this Chapter and any individual wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the Wastewater Division Manager ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and/or the performance of any additional duties. Monitoring and inspections shall be conducted at a frequency as determined by the City and may be announced or unannounced.</p>
    <p>Where a User has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the User shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the Wastewater Division Manager shall be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities.</p>
    <p>The Wastewater Division Manager shall have the right to set up on the User’s property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the User’s operations.</p>
    <p>The Wastewater Division Manager may require the User to install monitoring equipment, as necessary. The facility’s sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the User at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated per manufacturers recommendations to ensure their accuracy.</p>
    <p>Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the User at the written or verbal request of the Wastewater Division Manager and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the User.</p>
    <p>Unreasonable delays in allowing the Wastewater Division Manager access to the User’s premises shall be a violation of this ordinance.</p>
    <p>The City may use a camera to photograph areas of the facility as necessary for carrying out the duties of the pretreatment inspection including, but not limited to, documentation of the User’s compliance status and for reinforcement of written reports. The User shall be allowed to review copies of the photographs for confidentiality claims.</p>
    <p>Fees associated with analysis of samples taken for purposes of compliance monitoring shall be billed to and paid by the User.</p>
    <p>Search Warrants. If the Wastewater Division Manager has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this Chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the City designed to verify compliance with this Chapter or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the community, the Wastewater Division Manager may seek issuance of a search warrant as authorized by law.</p>
    <p>Notice of Violation/Repeat Sampling and Reporting. If sampling performed by a User indicates a violation, the User must notify the Wastewater Division Manager within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation. The User shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the Wastewater Division Manager within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the violation. Resampling by the Industrial User is not required if the City performs sampling at the User’s facility at least once a month, or if the City performs sampling at the User between the time when the initial sampling was conducted and the time when the User or the City receives the results of this sampling, or if the City has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the Industrial User.</p>
    <p>Failure to Permit Inspection. In the event a duly authorized officer or agent of the City is refused admission for any purpose, the Wastewater Division Manager may cause sewer service to the premises in question to be discontinued until the City's agents have been afforded reasonable access to the premises and sewer system to accomplish the inspection or sampling.</p>
    <p>Recordkeeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this Chapter shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying:</p>
    <p>All records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this Chapter,</p>
    <p>Any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the User independent of such requirements, and</p>
    <p>Documentation associated with Best Management Practices established in §13.24.110(I).</p>
    <p>Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses.These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the User or the City, or where the User has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the Wastewater Division Manager.</p>

    <p>All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application, report, permit or other requirement by this Chapter shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the Wastewater Division Manager or other parties approved by EPA.</p>
    <p>All laboratory samples collected for this ordinance shall be analysis by a laboratory that is either certified by the Utah Bureau of Laboratory Improvements or approved by the Wastewater Division Manager.</p>
    <p>Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report, based on data that is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period.</p>
    <p>Except as indicated in subparagraphs B and C below, the User must collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the Wastewater Division Manager. Where time proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the City, the samples must be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the City, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with Instantaneous Limits.</p>
    <p>Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques.</p>
    <p>For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90 day compliance reports required in §§13.24.110(E) and 13.24.160(B), a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the Wastewater division Manager may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by paragraphs in §13.24.160, the Industrial User is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by with applicable Pretreatment Standards and Requirements.</p>

    <h3>13.24.220 Repealed 07-16-2024 Violations</h3>
    <p>Notification of Violation. When the Wastewater Division Manager finds that a User has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, the Wastewater Division Manager may serve upon that User a written Notice of Violation. Within ten (10) days of the receipt of such notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the User to the Wastewater Division Manager. Submission of such a plan in no way relieves the User of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the Notice of Violation. Nothing in this Section shall limit the authority of the Wastewater Division Manager to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a Notice of Violation.</p>
    <p>Consent Order. The Wastewater Division Manager may enter into Consent Orders, assurances of compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any User responsible for noncompliance. Such documents shall include specific action to be taken by the User to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to subparagraphs D and E below and shall be judicially enforceable.</p>
    <p>Show Cause Hearing. The Wastewater Division Manager may order a User which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, to appear before the Wastewater Division Manager and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the User specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the User show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any Authorized Representative of the User as defined in §13.24.010(C) and required by §13.24.120(F). A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User.</p>
    <p>Compliance Order. When the Wastewater Division Manager finds that a User has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, the Wastewater Division Manager may issue an order to the User responsible for the discharge directing that the User come into compliance within a specified time. If the User does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the User of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User.</p>
    <p>Cease and Desist Orders. When the Wastewater Division Manager finds that a User has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, or that the User’s past violations are likely to recur, the Wastewater Division Manager may issue an order to the User directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the User to:</p>
    <p>Immediately comply with all requirements; and</p>
    <p>Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User.</p>
    <p>Administrative Fines.</p>
    <p>When the Wastewater Division Manager finds that a User has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, the Wastewater Division Manager may fine such User in an amount not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000) per violation. Such fines shall be assessed on a per-violation, per-day basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation.</p>
    <p>Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 30 calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of five percent (5%) of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of five percent (5%) per month. A lien against the User’s property shall be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties.</p>
    <p>Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the Wastewater Division Manager to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within ten (10) days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the Wastewater Division Manager may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the User’s appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the User. The Wastewater Division Manager may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.</p>
    <p>Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User.</p>
    <p>Emergency Suspensions. The Wastewater Division Manager may immediately suspend a User’s discharge, after informal notice to the User, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge, which reasonably appears to present, or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The Manager may also immediately suspend a User’s discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment.</p>
    <p>Any User notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a User’s failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Wastewater Division Manager may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The Wastewater Division Manager may allow the User to recommence its discharge when the User has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Wastewater Division Manager that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in paragraph H below initiated against the User.</p>
    <p>A User that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the Wastewater Division Manager prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under §13.24.220(C) and (H). Nothing in this Section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any Emergency Suspension of a permit and/or discharge to the POTW.</p>
    <p>Termination of Permit. Any User who violates the following conditions, provisions of this Chapter, a Wastewater Discharge Permit, order, or any applicable federal, State, and/or City regulation is subject to permit termination:</p>
    <p>Violation of individual wastewater discharge permit conditions;</p>
    <p>Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge;</p>
    <p>Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge;</p>
    <p>Refusal of reasonable access to the User's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or</p>
    <p>Violation of the Pretreatment Standards in §13.24.070.</p>
    <p>Such User will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under §13.24.220(C) why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the Wastewater Division Manager shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User.</p>
    <p>Appeal Procedure.</p>
    <p>Any person, including the User, may petition the Wastewater Division Manager to reconsider the terms of an individual wastewater discharge permit within ten (10) days of notice of its issuance.</p>
    <p>Failure to submit a timely petition for review shall be deemed to be a waiver of the administrative appeal.</p>
    <p>In its petition, the appealing party must indicate the individual wastewater discharge permit provisions objected to, the reasons for this objection, and the alternative condition, if any, it seeks to place in the individual wastewater discharge permit.</p>
    <p>The effectiveness of the individual wastewater discharge permit shall not be stayed pending the appeal.</p>
    <p>If the Wastewater Division Manager fails to act within ten (10) days, a request for reconsideration shall be deemed to be denied. Decisions not to reconsider an individual wastewater discharge permit, not to issue an individual wastewater discharge permit, or not to modify an individual wastewater discharge permit shall be considered final administrative actions for purposes of judicial review.</p>
    <p>If the decision of the Wastewater Division Manager is unsatisfactory to the User appealing, he/she may file a written appeal to the City Council within ten (10) days after receipt of the decision. The City Council must schedule a date to hear the appeal within forty-five (45) days from the receipt of the notice of appeal. A decision on the appeal shall be made within 21 days of the hearing. The decision, action, or determination of the Wastewater Division Manager shall remain in effect during such appeal period. The decision of the City Council shall be binding on all entities and the User until and unless ruled otherwise by an appropriate court.</p>
    <p>Judicial Remedies. If any person discharges sewage, industrial wastes, or other wastes into the wastewater disposal system contrary to the provisions of this Chapter, any order, or permit issued hereunder, the City, may commence an action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction within Utah County.</p>
    <p>Injunctive Relief. When the Wastewater Division Manager finds that a User has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, the Wastewater Division Manager may petition the Court through the City Attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the individual wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this Chapter on activities of the User. The Wastewater Division Manager may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the User to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a User.</p>
    <p>Civil Penalties.</p>
    <p>A User who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement shall be liable to the City for a maximum civil penalty of $1,000 per violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation.</p>
    <p>The Wastewater Division Manager may recover reasonable attorneys’ fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the City.</p>
    <p>In determining the amount of civil liability, the Court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the User’s violation, corrective actions by the User, the compliance history of the User, and any other factor as justice requires.</p>
    <p>Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a User.</p>
    <p>Criminal Prosecution.</p>
    <p>A User who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this Chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000 per violation, per day, and/or imprisonment for not more than one (1) year, or both.</p>
    <p>A User who willfully or negligently introduces any substance into the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction, be guilty of Class B misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty of $1,000, and/or be subject to imprisonment for not more than one (1) year, or both. This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for personal injury or property damage available under State law.</p>
    <p>A User who knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this Chapter, individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this Chapter shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000 per violation, per day, and/or imprisonment for not more than one (1) year, or both.</p>
    <p>Remedies Nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this Chapter are not exclusive. The Wastewater Division Manager may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the City’s enforcement response plan. However, the Wastewater Division Manager is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user.</p>

    <h3>13.24.230 Repealed 07-16-2024 Treatment Bypasses</h3>
    <p>For the purposes of this Section,</p>
    <p>Bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a User’s treatment facility.</p>
    <p>Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.</p>
    <p>A User may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause Pretreatment Standards or Requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subparagraphs C and D of this section.</p>
    <p>Bypass Notifications.</p>
    <p>If a User knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the Wastewater Division Manager, at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass, if possible.</p>
    <p>A User shall submit oral notice to the Wastewater Division Manager of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable Pretreatment Standards within twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the User becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The Wastewater Division Manager may waive the written report on a case by case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours.</p>
    <p>Bypass.</p>
    <p>Bypass is prohibited, and the Wastewater Division Manager may take an enforcement action against a User for a bypass, unless</p>
    <p>Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage;</p>
    <p>There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and</p>
    <p>The User submitted notices as required under subparagraph C of this section.</p>
    <p>The Wastewater Division Manager may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if [the Wastewater Division Manager determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in this subparagraph D.</p>
