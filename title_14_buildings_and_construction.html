    <h3>14.04.030 Construction Phases</h3>
    <p>The City may issue a building permit upon application, in compliance with all laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations. A partial building permit may be issued, upon application, and in compliance with rules and regulations established by the City Building Official. A fee established by the City Council, as adopted in the annual budget, may also be charged. The fee charged is in addition to the fees charged for the issuance of a building permit. A partial building permit will allow limited commencement of construction while the entire plans and specifications are under review. The issuance of a partial building permit is no guarantee that a building permit will be issued. Any applicant for a partial building permit may proceed with those items identified in the permit, at their own risk.</p>
    <p>No building permits will be issued until streets are in compliance with the applicable fire code to allow access to the construction site by fire apparatus vehicles. The City Engineer is hereby designated as the responsible official to determine compliance.</p>
    <p>No building permit will be issued until the water transfer required by Spanish Fork Municipal Code '13.12.010 (B) has been made.</p>
    <p>No building permit will be issued until all required impact fees have been collected.</p>
    <p>Once all approvals have been granted, a building permit may be obtained.</p>
    <p>No certificate of occupancy may be granted until roadbase, curb, gutter, and graveled driveways, related to the premises are installed by the contractor or developer and approved by the City.</p>
    <p>Upon issuance of a building permit a cash deposit in an amount to be established by the City Council in the annual budget shall also be collected. This deposit is to guarantee that all of the terms and conditions of the permit are met, site plan improvements are completed, any damage done to City facilities is repaired, and all fees are paid. If all of the conditions of the permit are met, the deposit shall be refunded to the person posting the same when a certificate of occupancy is issued. In the event that the conditions are not met within one year from occupancy, the deposit shall be forfeited to the City. The City may use the funds to install the required improvements, up to the amount of the bond, or may place the deposit funds into the general fund and perform the improvements later as part of a larger project.</p>
    <p>The city building official may charge such fees for reinspection as are established by the City Council in the annual budget. The building official may establish rules and regulations for any appeals process concerning reinspection.</p>
    <p>A temporary certificate of occupancy may be granted at the discretion of the building official when there are no life threatening hazards on the property and the conditions set forth in sub-paragraph (A) are met. The final checklist of terms to be completed must be minor in nature and must be completed in the time frame designated. The city council, in the annual budget, may establish a reasonable fee to be charged for the issuance of a temporary certificate of occupancy. In the event a temporary certificate expires and a final certificate has not been obtained, the City may disconnect all utility service to the property until the final checklist is completed and a final certificate of occupancy is obtained, and may also forfeit the deposit required in sub-paragraph C.</p>
    <p>The applicant of a single family residential building permit may appeal an inspection to determine whether an inspection constitutes a fair administration of the building code. A notice, in compliance with the Utah Code Annotated 58-56-20 shall be included with the issuance of the permit. The review contemplated by this section:</p>
    <p>is separate and unrelated to an appeal under the applicable building code;</p>
    <p>may not be used to review a matter that may be brought by appeal under the building code;</p>
    <p>may not result in a waiver or modification of the building code requirement or standard;</p>
    <p>may not conflict with an appeal, or the result of an appeal under the building code; and</p>
    <p>does not prohibit a person from bringing an appeal under the applicable building code.</p>
