<h3>15.3.04.020 Authority And Purpose</h3>
<p>This ordinance is adopted pursuant to the authority contained in Utah Code Annotated §10-9a-101 et seq. (1953 as amended) to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of the community. It is the intention of the Council that this ordinance and any amendments thereto implement the planning policies as expressed and adopted in the General Plan. The purpose of this ordinance is to:</p>
<p>Establish land use classifications dividing the City into various zoning districts.</p>
<p>Govern the use of land for residential, commercial, office, industrial, and all other uses.</p>
<p>Regulate and limit the height and bulk of buildings and other structures.</p>

<h3>15.3.04.030 Noncomplying Structures, Nonconforming Uses, And Lots</h3>
<p>These regulations are designed to regulate and protect the rights of legally existing nonconforming uses and noncomplying structures. Any lawful use or activity conducted under County zoning regulations at the effective date of Annexation or under previous City zoning regulations in effect at the adoption of this ordinance which no longer complies with the regulations of this ordinance shall be considered a legal nonconforming use or noncomplying structure. The site, structure, or use will be encouraged to convert to a conforming use in the future, although some limited expansion or enlargement may be allowed subject to the provisions of this section. A nonconforming use is lost if it is abandoned.</p>
<p>Abandonment may be presumed to have occurred if:</p>
<p>A majority of the primary structure associated with the nonconforming use has been voluntarily demolished without prior written agreement with the City regarding an extension of the nonconforming use.</p>
<p>The use has been discontinued for a minimum of one (1) year.</p>
<p>The primary structure associated with the nonconforming use remains vacant for a period of one (1) year.</p>
<p>A legal nonconforming use may continue subject to the following limitations:</p>
<p>A noncomplying structure may not be reconstructed or structurally altered during its life to an extent in the aggregate of 50% of the fair market value of the building without the approval of the Planning Commission.</p>
<p>A building that does not conform to setback regulations may be added to as long as the portion to be added conforms to the setback regulations.</p>
<p>Any legal lot which does not conform to lot area or lot dimensions for the zoning district in which it is located may be used for any use permitted in that district provided all other applicable City and zoning regulations are complied with. However, substandard residential lots will be restricted to the number of homes allowed in accordance with this ordinance, except as otherwise permitted in this section.</p>
<p>No noncomplying structure or use shall be changed to another nonconforming use.</p>
<p>A noncomplying structure or a nonconforming use of a structure that has been damaged by fire, flood, explosion, or an act of God can be rebuilt or repaired. The new structure must be constructed using the same footprint as prior to being destroyed. The new structure will need to meet all other applicable Building Codes and zoning regulations.</p>
<p>A noncomplying structure that has been allowed to deteriorate to a condition that the structure is rendered uninhabitable and is not repaired or restored within six months after written notice to the property owner from the City may not be reconstructed or restored and any nonconforming use shall be lost.</p>
<p>Expansion, enlargement, or reconstruction: Limited expansion, enlargement or reconstruction: of a nonconforming use or noncomplying structure may be considered and approved by the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission will hold a public hearing and review the expansion, enlargement or reconstruction. The Planning Commission may place certain conditions on the operation, expansion, or reconstruction to help mitigate potential impacts and to increase compatibility of the use with surrounding development and the City as a whole.</p>
<p>Nonconforming signs shall be removed or brought into conformance with this ordinance when:</p>
<p>When a sign is damaged, destroyed or deteriorated and the cost of repairs exceeds 50% of the reproduction cost of the sign or sign structure.</p>
<p>The property undergoes development or redevelopment in accordance with the Design Review section of this ordinance.</p>

<h3>15.3.08.060 Conditional Use Permits</h3>
<p>Purpose: Certain uses have characteristics that may have a greater impact on the adjoining properties, surrounding neighborhood, or community as a whole than do other permitted uses in the specific zoning district. These uses require a more comprehensive review to determine whether the proposed use at a specific location is appropriate, or whether the use can be made compatible by placing certain conditions on its operation that mitigate or eliminate potential detrimental impacts. The Commission is the Land Use Authority for Conditional Use Permits and is empowered to approve, to approve with conditions, or to deny the Conditional Use Permit application, subject to the findings and hearing requirements of this section. A Conditional Use application expires if it is not approved by the City within 24 months from the time its application is submitted and accepted.</p>
<p>Application: Application is made by following the instructions on the electronic form provided by the Community Development Department and submitting all required materials.</p>
<p>Findings: The DRC shall consider, and the Commission must make the following findings prior to granting a Conditional Use Permit:</p>
<p>The proposed use is consistent with the policies of the City’s General Plan and the purpose of the zoning district in which the site is located.</p>
<p>The proposed use will not be materially detrimental to the health, safety, or general welfare of persons residing or working within the neighborhood of the proposed use, when consideration is given to the character and size of the use and hours of operation.</p>
<p>The proposed site is adequate in size and shape to accommodate the intended use, and that all requirements for the zoning district, including but not limited to: setbacks, walls, landscaping and buffer yards are met.</p>
<p>The proposed site has adequate access to public streets to carry the type and quantity of traffic which may be generated by the use, and that on-site circulation is adequate to permit driveways, parking, pedestrian ways, and loading requirements in a manner which is safe and efficient.</p>
<p>Adequate conditions or stipulations have been incorporated into the approval of the Conditional Use Permit to ensure that any anticipated detrimental effects are minimized.</p>
<p>Review and Public Hearing Procedures:</p>
<p>Development Review Committee: Completed applications will be reviewed by the DRC and evaluated in accordance with the criteria described in the above “Findings”. The DRC shall forward a recommendation to the Planning Commission for approval, approval with conditions, or denial based upon consideration and evaluation of the “Findings”.</p>
<p>Planning Commission: The Commission shall hold at least one (1) public hearing on the application. Prior to the hearing, notice shall be provided as described in §15.1.04.040. The Commission shall consider the recommendation of the DRC, together with information provided by the applicant, and any statements made at the public hearing both for and against the application. The Commission shall approve, approve with conditions, or deny the application.</p>
<p>Conditions may be imposed on the use which is deemed necessary to mitigate potential impacts and ensure compatibility of the use with surrounding development and the City as a whole. These conditions may include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>Requirements for setbacks, open spaces, buffers, fences or walls, and landscaping; the purpose of which is to mitigate conflicts from visual, noise, lighting, and similar impacts associated with the use.</p>
<p>Dedication and/or improvements of street or other public rights-of-way, control location of access points, and on-site circulation, to mitigate traffic impacts from increased volumes or nature of traffic activity associated with the use.</p>
<p>Limitations on hours of operation, methods of operation, building height and size, on-site lighting and on signage.</p>
<p>Revocation: Failure to comply with the conditions or stipulations of a Conditional Use Permit is a violation of this ordinance and will be enforced as such. Revocation procedures may be initiated and processed by the Planning Commission as follows:</p>
<p>The City shall notify, by certified mail, the holder of the Conditional Use Permit of the intention to conduct a hearing to consider the revocation of the Conditional Use Permit. Notice shall be postmarked at least 15 days prior to the date of the scheduled hearing. At the hearing the Planning Commission shall consider evidence from all interested parties, and after consideration of all available information, may revoke the Conditional Use Permit if it is determined that conditions or stipulations of the approved Permit have not been met.</p>
<p>Transfer of Conditional Use Permit: A Conditional Use Permit granted in accordance with this section shall run with the land and continue to be valid regardless of ownership of the site or structure, as long as it operates within the conditions or stipulations of the Conditional Use Permit approval.</p>

<h3>15.3.16.010 Agricultural And Rural Residential Districts</h3>
<p>A-E. Exclusive Agriculture. The purpose of this district is to promote agricultural production on lands with high quality soil types. The lands will usually not be suited for other urban uses because of location within a floodplain, or distance to other urban services. All agricultural uses are allowed in this zone. A cannabis cultivation facility is permitted with conditions (see SFMC §5.48.030(A) and (B))</p>
<p>R-R. Rural Residential. This district is similar in character to the A-E District, but parcel sizes are generally somewhat smaller and the soil types may be lower quality. Many of these areas within the Growth Management boundary will likely be rezoned and developed with higher density uses as utilities are extended and adequate streets are developed and/or widened. Other lands outside the Growth Management Boundary may eventually be converted to urban uses when a need is shown to expand that boundary.</p>

<h3>15.3.16.100 C-UV Urban Village Commercial</h3>
<p>This district is intended to provide controlled and compatible settings for a wide range of commercial and residential uses in the same area, uses designed to serve neighborhood, community, and regional needs. Uses may be freestanding or integrated in a center. Developments in this district will be designed towards pedestrians in mind; designs will have the character of an urban village; with high quality materials being used. The Planning Commission will review all Site Plans and subdivisions.</p>
<p>Permitted Uses:</p>
<p>Dental and Medical Offices.</p>
<p>Financial Institutions with no drive-thru services.</p>

<p>Seasonal sales and special events (as described in §15.3.24.050 et seq.).</p>
<p>Uses Subject to Conditional Use Permit (see §15.3.08.060):</p>
<p>Adult Day Care.</p>
<p>Child Care Centers.</p>
<p>Financial Institutions with drive-thru facilities.</p>
<p>Restaurants with drive-thru facilities.</p>
<p>Accessory Buildings and Uses (see §15.3.24.090).</p>
<p>Site Plan/Design Review/Performance Standards (see §15.4.08.010 et seq.): These standards are intended to foster the creation of an urban environment that accommodates growth and is compatible with the existing homes and uses in the area:</p>
<p>Outdoor Sales, Display and Storage. The outdoor permanent sales or display of merchandise shall not encroach into areas of required parking, sidewalks, or landscaping.</p>
<p>Lighting. On-site lighting, including parking lot lighting and illuminated signs, shall be located, directed or designed in a manner to prevent glare on adjacent properties and be designed for pedestrians. All lighting should have the same design elements throughout the development.</p>
<p>Location of Service Areas. All loading docks and other service activities shall be located away from view of any public street. Exceptions to this requirement may be approved through the Site Plan Process. If such activities are permitted adjacent to a public street, a visual screening design approved by the Planning Department shall be required.</p>
<p>Urban Design. Designs for this area should envision a “village character” relating to the heritage of the early residents of the community. Safe and efficient pedestrian circulation is a priority:</p>
<p>Architectural Character and Materials.</p>
<p>A differentiated base will provide human scale through change, contrast, and intricacy in facade form. Scaling elements such as insets and projections serve to break up flat or monotonous facades along with color and a change in materials.</p>
<p>The climate in Spanish Fork City is such that in the summer months’ shade is preferred, and in the winter months, protection from the snow and wind is necessary. By providing the pedestrian with a sidewalk that is enjoyable to use year-round, a pedestrian oriented development is encouraged. Therefore, the following will be encouraged.</p>
<p>Arcades, Awnings and/or marquees.</p>
<p>Entrance and Visual Access.</p>
<p>The intent in this district is to encourage pedestrian activity between the public street/sidewalk and buildings. Sidewalks shall provide continuous, uninterrupted access and amenities. The environment will benefit with increased pedestrian activity, this activity will only occur if opportunities are provided that make walking to a destination a preferred and an enjoyable pursuit. The use of blank building facade walls is discouraged. Therefore, all buildings in this district are subject to the following standards:</p>
<p>Minimum First Floor Glass. The first-floor elevation of a commercial building facing a street shall not have less than 40% glass surfaces. All first-floor glass shall be non-reflective. Display windows that are three (3) dimensional and are at least two (2) feet deep are permitted and may be counted toward the 40% glass requirement.</p>
<p>Provide at least one (1) operable building entrance per elevation that faces a public street. Buildings that face multiple streets are only required to have one door on either street, if the facades for both streets meet the 40% glass requirement.</p>
<p>The maximum length of any blank wall uninterrupted by windows, doors, art or architectural detailing at the first-floor level shall be 40 feet.</p>
<p>All building equipment and service areas, including on-grade and roof mechanical equipment and transformers that are readily visible from the public right-of-way, shall be screened from public view.</p>
<p>Public Amenities and Public Art.</p>
<p>Amenities and works of art enhance quality of life as well as visual interest. Public amenities and art encourage pedestrian activity and contribute to the “village” experience. A cohesive, unified lighting and amenity policy will help give the district its own distinctive identity. Therefore, all projects will be required to have public amenities and art that are subject to the following standards:</p>
<p>Sidewalks and street lamps installed in the public right of way shall be of the type specified in the City’s construction and development standards. All parking lot lights will be required to match the City’s standards.</p>
<p>Park benches will be required within the development.</p>
<p>Public art (which may include artists’ work integrated into the design of the building, and landscaping, sculpture, painting, murals, glass, mixed media or work by artisans), that is accessible or directly viewable to the general public shall be included in all projects. The plan to incorporate public art shall be reviewed and approved by the Spanish Fork Arts Council.</p>
<p>All projects will be required to have a minimum of 20% open space and developments with residential units will be required to have 35% open space.</p>
<p>Conditional Use Approval. A modification to the urban design/performance provisions of this section may be granted as a conditional use, subject to conformance with the standards and procedures.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this section, “Façade” means the front of a building, or any other “face” of a building on a street or courtyard given special architectural treatment.</p>
<p>Landscaping, Buffering, Walls (see §15.4.16.130) Same as the S-C zone requirements.</p>
<p>Signs (see §5.36.101 et seq.). All individual developments (not a planned center) must follow the requirements of the C-O zone.</p>
<p>Parking Standards (see §15.4.16.120).</p>
<p>Restrictions on Parking Lots. The following regulations shall apply to parking facilities.</p>
<p>All parking lots adjacent to a public street will be required to have a 25-foot landscape setback and a minimum three (3) foot berm, with trees spaced every 30 feet.</p>
<p>Solid Waste Receptacle Areas (see §15.4.16.140).</p>
<p>Building Height. Same as the S-C zones requirements.</p>
<p>Height Exceptions: spires, towers, or decorative non-inhabitable elements shall have a maximum height of 60 feet measured from the street grade.</p>
<p>Development Standards.</p>
<p>Projects are allowed a density of five (5) to 12 residential units per acre.</p>
<p>Projects will be required to have public art integrated and 35% open space area.</p>
<p>Projects with a residential component will be required to have at least 30% of the project’s total building square footage dedicated to commercial or office uses. The City will require that this ratio be maintained with each phase of the development.</p>
<p>Residential units will be required to meet the High Density Residential (R-3) setbacks.</p>
<p>Residential units must be designed in a manner to blend with the urban village and not be a separate element of the area.</p>

<h3>15.3.20.050 Self Storage Overlay</h3>
<p>This district is intended to provide for the development of new Self Storage Warehouses and/or Recreational Vehicle Storage while protecting the City’s potential for economic growth by preserving sites that could potentially support retail, professional office, or manufacturing uses. This district shall overlay the Light Industrial I-1 zoning district where it is applied.</p>
<p>Permitted Uses:</p>
<p>Self-Storage Warehouses and/or Recreational Vehicle Storage.</p>
<p>Application: Applications to establish a Self-Storage Overlay District shall be processed in the same manner as that for other zoning amendments. The application shall be accompanied by a development plan including the following information:</p>
<p>Legal description of the property.</p>
<p>An area map showing adjacent property owners and locations of all buildings and existing uses within 600 feet of the property.</p>
<p>Narrative and Site Plan for the proposed facility including phasing plans, proposed buildings or structures, landscaping, lighting, and other site improvements.</p>
<p>Performance Standards: The Self-Storage Overlay District may only be approved in the I-1 Light Industrial zoning district. The Self Storage Overlay may not be approved within 1,000 feet of the 2700 North/Interstate 15 overpass or within 250 feet of Main Street or Interstate 15. An exception to the restrictions exists for parcels that abut the planned site for the City's new wastewater treatment plant.</p>
<p>Findings: The following findings must be made by the Council before approving any Self Storage Overlay District:</p>
<p>There is no recognizable potential for retail uses on the subject property.</p>
<p>That access and/or visibility to the subject property is limited to some degree which limits its development potential for retail, office, or manufacturing uses.</p>
<p>The site’s configuration makes the site ill-suited for another use.</p>
<p>The subject property is small enough that it will not support manufacturing or other uses that would create employment opportunities.</p>
<p>The proposed site has adequate access to public streets to carry the type and quantity of traffic which may be generated by the use.</p>
<p>That adequate conditions or stipulations have been incorporated into the approval of the operation to ensure that any anticipated detrimental effects can be minimized.</p>
<p>The Site Plan adequately describes screening and other improvements that make the development an attractive addition to the City.</p>

<h3>15.3.20.060 Development Enhancement Overlay</h3>
<p>This district is intended to provide an ability to develop properties within R-O Residential Office Zone, C-O Commercial Office Zone, C-2 General Commercial Zone, S-C Shopping Center Zone, C-UV Urban Village Commercial Zone, I-1 Light Industrial Zone, and B-P Business Park Zone which otherwise have a difficult time meeting the standards for those zones for any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, parking standards, landscaping standards, etc.</p>
<p>Permitted Uses: Uses permitted in the underlying zone are allowed with the Development Enhancement Overlay Zone.</p>
<p>Limitations: The Development Enhancement Overlay Zone is limited to the specific use approved. When the specific use ceases to operate at the approved location, the property reverts to the underlying zone.</p>
<p>Performance Standards: In those situations, when it has been found that a development cannot meet the requirements of development in the allowed zones, the Development Enhancement Overlay Zone may be requested and approved. The application will be analyzed on a case by case basis, paying particular attention to the provisions of the underlying zone which the Developer cannot meet.</p>
<p>The City Council has the discretion to impose conditions with the Development Enhancement Overlay Zone to mitigate negative impacts incurred by not meeting the standard requirements, which may include architectural requirements, color requirements, more intense landscaping, shared parking with adjacent uses, height requirements, signage requirements, lighting requirements, or others deemed appropriate in the specific circumstances to compensate for any deficiencies in the standard requirements. If the City Community Development Director deems it helpful, an appropriate study may be required of the Developer addressing the deficiency in the standards, why a more lenient standard works for the specific intended use, and how to compensate for the deficiency.</p>
<p>Application: In order to have the Development Enhancement Overlay Zone approved, a developer must submit an application, on the electronic form provided by the City, spelling out the requirements which cannot be met in the particular zone, why the requirements cannot be met, why the developer believes the requirements do not need to be met in this specific instance, how the deficiency will not adversely impact neighboring properties, and proposing conditions which will provide a solution.</p>
<p>City Findings: The City Council may approve an application for the Development Enhancement Overlay Zone, with conditions as outlined in subparagraph B, upon making the following findings:</p>
<p>That the proposed use is an appropriate use on the specific parcel as compared with other possible uses;</p>
<p>That granting the Development Enhancement Overlay Zone with modified restrictions will not cause a detriment to prospective patrons, to adjacent property owners, nor to traffic flows on the adjacent public streets;</p>
<p>That adequate conditions have been incorporated into the Zone which will offset the easing of usual requirements;</p>
<p>If a study has been submitted by the Developer, the Council accepts the study as accurate as far as addressing the more lenient standards and the impact it will have on adjacent property owners and the City.</p>

<h3>15.3.20.080 Master Planned Development Overlay District</h3>
<p>This district is an alternative to developing property by strict adherence to standard zoning and development requirements, which may only be approved as a Zoning Map Amendment as provided in this section. The Master Planned Development (MDP) Overlay District is not a replacement for a standard subdivision but serves as an option. It is intended to provide an option in order to create residential neighborhoods that will increase in value over time by doing the following:</p>
<p>allowing for efficient designs that provide needed public infrastructure,</p>
<p>allowing for deviations from typical zoning standards in order to permit uniquely configured or situated properties to be developed in a functional manner that enhances the City,</p>
<p>allowing developments to include a total number of units up to the maximum density found in the underlying zone as identified in Table 1 - Residential Development Standards of Title 15,</p>
<p>establishing residential neighborhoods with a distinct character and sense of unity, and allowing for the development of neighborhoods with multi-family homes and a mixture of housing types.</p>
<p>Application</p>
<p>Applications to establish a Master Planned Development Overlay District shall be processed in the same manner as that for other zoning map amendments. The application shall be accompanied by a complete Preliminary Plat or Site Plan application which includes the following information:</p>
<p>a complete description of the intended nature and character of the development,</p>
<p>a description of all proposed private or public open space areas, including improvements, ownership, and maintenance provisions,</p>
<p>a proposed project phasing,</p>
<p>plans representing proposed landscaping, fences, walls, entry treatments, signage and lighting,</p>
<p>preliminary conditions, covenants, and restrictions (CC&amp;R's),</p>
<p>any variations from the non-Master Planned Development standards,</p>
<p>any proposed amended development standards, including such things as variations in setbacks, heights, and lot sizes,</p>
<p>a data table which includes total acreage, acreage of sensitive lands, total number of homes and units by type, dwelling units per acre, acreage of open space, percent of acreage in open space, and</p>
<p>a phasing plan that specifies the timing of public improvements and residential construction. This plan must be submitted at the submission of the Preliminary Plat or Site Plan. If the sequence of construction of various portions of the development is to occur in stages, then the amenities shall be developed, or committed thereto, in proportion to the number of homes intended to be developed during any given stage of construction.</p>
<p>Performance Standards</p>
<p>Permitted Use</p>
<p>All uses listed in R-1, R-3, R-4, and R-5 Districts, subject to the same restrictions or limitations of the use.</p>
<p>Multi-family homes.</p>
<p>Subdivision Design</p>
<p>Project size. The minimum size of a development is five (5) gross contiguous acres in R-1-8, R-1-9, R-1-12, R-1-15, R-1-20, R-1-30, and R-1-40 Zones. The minimum size of a development in the R-1-6, R-3, and R-5 zones is two (2) gross contiguous acres. The minimum size of a development in the R-4 zone is twelve (12) gross contiguous residential acres. School, church and other non-residential sites are to be excluded from the acreage calculation.</p>
<p>Density calculations and lot size. Density shall be limited to the base density per acre as defined in Table 1 - Residential Development Standards. Church sites, school sites, other non-residential uses, sensitive lands and land that is unbuildable by encumbrance or otherwise may not be counted in the density calculations. The average lot size for any development must meet or exceed the minimum lot size required for a standard subdivision in that zone. For projects that include land with multiple zoning districts, the total allowed density will be the sum of the allowed density for each of the distinctly zoned areas. This density may be dispersed throughout the project provided that average lot sizes in the project are commensurate with the distinctly zoned areas. Where projects include features that serve as amenities for the development, plazas, entrance features, private park, the land area of those features may be included in the lot area for purposes of calculating average lot size. Where projects include uniquely large lots, the area of the uniquely large lots that is included for purposes of calculating project density and average lot size shall be limited to twice the minimum lot size of the Zoning District.</p>
<p>Street design. Local streets shall not exceed 600 feet in length without an intersecting street.</p>
<p>Infrastructure. Inasmuch as isolated, disconnected developments and their public infrastructure systems are an undesirable, inefficient, and in some cases a dangerous condition, developments shall provide infrastructure necessary to serve the MPD and to connect it to surrounding developments, undeveloped property, and anticipated future growth. The MPD must enhance infrastructure connectivity between the MPD and its surroundings by providing road and utility stubs where appropriate. Infrastructure that is intended for public use shall be dedicated to the City. Design, arrangement, and layout of developments may be adjusted by the City to achieve the goals of this section.</p>
<p>Architecture</p>
<p>Minimum house sizes, finished area (square feet). For the purposes of calculating required finished area, square footage in basements shall not qualify. For split level homes, finished area on floors that are at least 50%below the finished grade of the lot shall not count towards the required finished area.</p>

<p>Distinct designs. Development shall include a variety of home styles to ensure a diverse and interesting streetscape. Neighborhoods that have repetitive single-family homes constructed along the same street are not allowed. In order to ensure that the neighborhood is non-repetitive, the same street facing elevation shall not be built on adjacent lots on the same street or on lots directly or diagonally across the street from one another. Different elevations shall be characterized by elements such as, but not limited to, distinct footprints, rooflines, cladding materials or architectural features which contribute to home designs that are easily distinguishable from other home designs along the same street.</p>
<p>Parking. Developments in the R-4, R-3, R-1-6, R-1-8, R-1-9, R-1-12, R-1-15, R-1-20, R-1-30, and R-1-40 zones shall provide at least two and a half (2.5) parking spaces per home in the development. Developments in the R-5 zone shall provide at least two and one-quarter (2.25) parking spaces per home in the development. A two (2) car garage for each single-family residence is required. Townhomes and multi-family units must have one (1) attached or detached garage (minimum 12 feet x 20 feet) per unit. Developments shall include no less than one-half (0.5) guest parking spaces per home. Developments that include, with each home, a two (2) car garage and driveway space for two (2) vehicles shall not be required to provide additional guest parking. When required guest parking shall be located within 200 feet of each home.</p>
<p>Roofs. Single-family homes in the development shall have at least a 6/12 pitched roof on the main portion of the roof unless it is determined by the Community Development Department that a lesser pitch roof is essential to maintain the integrity of a particular architectural style and that the style is a substantial improvement to what would be built in a standard subdivision.</p>
<p>Exterior materials. Homes shall be clad in masonry, or masonry-based materials or a chemically-treated, wood-based, nail-on, lap siding that has at least a 50-year warranty. The City Council may grant a waiver of this requirement based upon superior architectural design plans which involve other materials.</p>
<p>Landscaping</p>
<p>Developments shall meet all applicable landscaping requirements including those found in 15.4.16.130. Applications for Master Planned Developments shall also include a Street Tree Plan that identifies where trees shall be installed in the park-strips of public rights-of-way throughout the development. Trees included in the Plan shall be spaced 30 feet apart, shall not be placed in restricted areas found in 15.4.16.150 and shall be selected from the Spanish Fork City Shade Tree List. Street trees in Master Planned Developments shall be installed prior to a Certificate of Occupancy being granted for the adjacent lot unless provisions are made for the developer to provide financial assurance to the City that the trees will be installed at a later time.</p>
<p>Findings: the following findings must be made by the Council before approving any Master Planned Development Overlay District and accompanying Preliminary Plat:</p>
<p>That the proposed development will provide a more pleasant and attractive living environment than a conventional residential development established under the application of the provisions of the underlying zone.</p>
<p>That the proposed development will not be materially detrimental to the health, safety, or general welfare of persons residing or working within the neighborhood.</p>
<p>That any variation allowed from the development standards of the underlying district will not create increased hazards to the health, safety, or general welfare of the residents of the development of adjacent areas.</p>
<p>That the development will improve infrastructure connectivity.</p>

The specific conditions associated with each Temporary Use will address the approved duration of the use, the precise nature of the use, the scope of the use and any others deemed appropriate for a particular situation. Business operating approved Temporary Uses must maintain a valid Spanish Fork City Business License.</p>
<p>L. Amateur Radio Antennas:</p>
<p>1.This section shall apply to amateur radio, also known as HAM radio, antennas and support structures.</p>
<p>2. General Regulations. Amateur radio antennas and support structures are allowed as a permitted use in all zones up to a height of forty-five (45) feet, subject to the conditions of this section. All amateur radio antennas and support structures shall comply with the following requirements.</p>
<p>a. All facilities shall comply with any pertinent regulations of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).</p>
<p>b. A building permit is required for any antenna and support structure with a combined height over twelve (12) feet. The design and construction of the antenna, as demonstrated by manufacturer specifications or by certification of a design professional (architect, professional engineer, or structural engineer) and support structure must be able to withstand wind loads of 80 mph and greater.</p>
<p>c. No more than one amateur radio support structure per lot or parcel may be installed. A support structure may only be located in the rear yard of a home or primary structure. A roof-mounted antenna shall be allowed provided that the height of the antenna and support structure does not exceed twelve (12) feet above the roof.</p>
<p>d. Setbacks for all amateur radio support structures shall be at least twenty feet (20’) from neighboring property lines and a minimum of thirty feet (30’) from any public right of way.</p>
<p>e. Support structures and all antennas, including when such antennas are fully extended, shall be located entirely upon and within the owner’s private property. No part of a support structure or antenna may extend beyond the boundaries of the lot or parcel upon which it is located, including into the right-of-way of any public or private street. No part of an antenna or support structure may be closer than 15 feet from an electric distribution conductor or 30 feet from an electric transmission conductor.</p>
<p>f. A support structure shall be composed of non-reflective galvanized steel or aluminum and shall be a neutral color or a color to match the background against which it will be most commonly seen.</p>
<p>g. Antennas are to be installed on a building or property in the least conspicuous location possible.</p>
<p>h. A support structure in a residential zone may not make use of guy wires.</p>
<p>i. Antennas shall be retracted, lowered, nested, or otherwise moved to a resting position when they are not being actively used for transmitting and receiving signals.</p>
<p>3. Conditional Use for Additional Height, Lesser Setbacks. The City desires to provide reasonable accommodations for antennas and support structures, where appropriate, to ensure the standards contained in this section represent the minimum practicable regulation to accomplish the City’s legitimate safety and aesthetic purposes. A conditional use permit shall be granted by the Planning Commission to allow amateur radio antennas and support structures to exceed 45 feet in height or to be setback less than the distance required by this section if it finds that the additional height or lesser setback will not create any negative impact or if reasonable conditions are proposed, or can be imposed, to mitigate the reasonably anticipated detrimental effects of the additional height or lesser setback in accordance with applicable standards. It is the intent of the City to reasonably accommodate antennas and support structures to the greatest extent practicable without negatively impacting public safety or the aesthetic quality of the neighborhood in which they are located. Antennas and support structures will generally not be allowed at a greater height or lesser setback to the extent the greater height or lesser setback negatively impacts the public safety or aesthetics of the neighborhood in which they are located. In determining whether amateur radio antennas and support structures should be allowed to exceed 45 feet in height or have a lesser setback, the Planning Commission shall consider the following factors:</p>
<p>a. The potential negative impact on public safety, especially the safety of life and property in the public rights-of-way or on adjacent properties.</p>
<p>b. The potential negative impact that the structure will have on the views of properties in the neighborhood. Special consideration shall be given to the impact on the views of attractive natural features such as the Wasatch Mountains, the Spanish Fork River bottoms, and Utah Lake.</p>
<p>c. The potential negative impact that the structure will have on the overall aesthetic quality of the neighborhood in which the structure is located.</p>
<p>d. The potential impact the structure may have on property values in the neighborhood in which the structure is located as demonstrated by a market analysis or appraisal. Speculative testimony is insufficient to establish any impact upon property values.</p>
<p>e. The need of the owner/operator for an antenna and support structure in excess of 45 feet or for a lesser setback distance.</p>
<p>f. The extent to which any reasonably anticipated detrimental effects of the structure can be mitigated. Factors that may reduce the negative impact that a structure will have on the aesthetic quality of a neighborhood and which may be made a condition(s) for the allowance of a height greater than 45 feet or lesser setback include but are not limited to the following:</p>
<p>1. For additional height, setbacks from adjoining property that significantly exceed the required setbacks listed in subsection (1)(d) above.</p>
<p>2. The current existence and use of trees or other means to screen or camouflage the structure.</p>
<p>3. The use of a retractable support structure, which is retracted when not in use or which is fully extended only during limited hours so long as the antenna, when extended, does not cross property lines.</p>
<p>4. The location of a support structure adjacent to land that is undeveloped and not likely to be developed due to topography or other characteristics. Streets may not be considered as undeveloped land.</p>
<p>5. The location of a support structure in or adjacent to commercial property, churches, schools, parks, or similar property such that the support structure will not unreasonably impair the views of residential property owners.</p>
<p>6. Any other factor that could reasonably mitigate the negative impact of the structure.</p>
<p>g. The existence of one or more of the conditions listed above does not create a presumption that the negative impacts of an antenna or antenna support structure are adequately mitigated.</p>
<p>4. Abandonment. An antenna or support structure shall be deemed to be abandoned and must be removed if the antenna is not used for a period of two (2) years or more. However, this two-year period shall not run during any time when the owner is away on a temporary leave of absence due to military service, a volunteer service assignment, ecclesiastical assignment, or other similar absence.</p>

<h3>15.3.28.080 Evaluation Criteria</h3>
<p>In evaluating a proposal and in determining whether or not to create or recommend the creation of an agriculture protection area, the Advisory Board, Planning Commission, and City Council shall apply the following criteria:</p>
<p>Whether or not the land is currently being used for agriculture production;</p>
<p>Whether or not the land is zoned for agriculture use;</p>
<p>Whether or not the land is viable for agricultural production;</p>
<p>The extent and nature of existing or proposed farm improvements;</p>
<p>Anticipated trends in agricultural and technological conditions; and</p>
<p>Whether the land contains land planned by the City or another political subdivision or state agency for a roadway, park, utility corridor, or commercial development as determined by the official maps of the City or other political subdivision or state agency. Such areas may be excluded from the agriculture protection area.</p>
<p>No single criterion is necessary or sufficient for the establishment of an agriculture protection area. Rather, the criteria in this section are for evaluation and consideration by the Advisory Board, Planning Commission, and the City Council.</p>

<h3>15.4.04.080 Approval Or Disapproval - Procedure</h3>
<p>Each plat submitted to the City shall be referred to the DRC for review to insure conformity to the present ordinances and standards and for adequacy and availability of public facilities.</p>
<p>Approval of a preliminary subdivision plat shall not be granted until such time as the applicant has provided information, to the satisfaction of the City Engineer, to establish that adequate public facilities exist in the areas affected by the development to accommodate the development.</p>
<p>The public facilities to which the preceding paragraph applies shall include the following:</p>
<p>The City culinary water system, including quantity, quality, treatment, storage capacity, transmission capacity, and distribution capacity.</p>
<p>The City sanitary sewer system, including treatment, overall capacity, outfall lines, laterals, and collector lines.</p>
<p>The City electric power system, including generation, transformation, transmission, and distribution.</p>
<p>The storm water system, including drainage and flood control facilities.</p>
<p>Streets and roads, including arterial and collector roads, sidewalks, curb and gutter, and related transportation facilities.</p>
<p>City pressurized irrigation system, including transmission and distribution capacity.</p>
<p>The adequacy of public facilities shall be determined in accordance with the Spanish Fork City development standards, the various master plans and the comprehensive general plan of the City, and at the discretion of the City Engineer. In the event that the City Engineer determines that adequate public facilities are not available and will not be available by the time of final plat approval, so as to assure that adequate public services are available at the time of occupancy, the following alternatives may be elected, at the discretion of the City Council:</p>
<p>Allowing the developer to voluntarily construct those public facilities which are necessary to service the proposed development and provide adequate facilities as determined by the City Engineer and by entering into an appropriate form of pioneering or development agreement, which may include, as deemed appropriate by the City Engineer, provisions for recoupment of any expenses incurred above and beyond those reasonably necessary for or related to the need created by or the benefit conferred upon the proposed development, and the method and conditions upon which recoupment is to be obtained. If an owner or developer plans to apply for a pioneering agreement at the conclusion of a project, the owner or developer shall submit a Notice of Pioneering Intent Application, pay the applicable fees, and post a bond for the pioneering infrastructure. Any pioneering agreement authorized by this paragraph must be requested within 120 days of the completion and acceptance by City of the improvements. The City Public Works Director may extend the deadline for up to an additional term upon good cause show. A request for a pioneering agreement shall be made on forms provided by the City. An application fee in an amount to cover the City’s expenses in preparing the pioneering agreement shall be included. The amount of the fee shall be established by the City Council in the annual budget or by resolution. Upon execution of a pioneering agreement a Notice of Development Obligations, giving notice of the existence of the pioneering agreement, shall be recorded against the properties that are benefitted by the pioneering infrastructure. The Public Works Director is authorized to sign Notices of Pioneering Intent and notices of Development Obligations and record them against the properties to be benefitted by the pioneering infrastructure.</p>
<p>Requiring the timing, sequencing, and phasing of the proposed development consistent with the availability of adequate public facilities.</p>
<p>Deferring Final Plat approval and the issuance of building permits until all necessary public facilities are adequate and available.</p>
<p>Denying plat approval and allowing the applicant to reapply when adequate public facilities are available.</p>
<p>The applicant shall follow the procedures set forth in Utah Code Ann. §73-1-15.5, as it may be amended from time to time, in contacting any applicable irrigation company whose facilities will be affected by the development. The applicant is to follow the requirements of said section in piping, improving, or relocating any irrigation facilities. Construction plans, in compliance with said section, shall be submitted with the application. The applicant is to provide a certificate of compliance that satisfies the City Engineer that it is compliant with the law.</p>
<p>Existing irrigation ditches located on the site or adjacent to a property boundary, within 10 feet, shall be treated in accordance with this section. Ditches shall be piped with a sufficient size pipe to handle the irrigation need or, if approved by the Development Review Committee, an opaque fence or wall shall be constructed to screen the ditch from lots within the plat. Fences and walls shall be placed on a lot line or parcel line, which shall be two feet from the tow of the ditch embankment. Any land between the fence or wall and the ditch may not be included within lots. Such land shall be maintained by the owner or may be dedicated to the City. Piping shall be coordinated with the City Engineer and the irrigation company or ditch owner by following the provisions of Utah Code Ann. §73-1-15.5, unless otherwise approved by the City Engineer. If the ditch carries greater than 50 cubic feet per second average flow, the Development Review Committee has the discretion to require piping, fencing, and/or landscaping.</p>
<p>Development Review Committee may waive this requirement for areas zoned commercial or industrial.</p>
<p>Developers are responsible for the protection of irrigation ditches and facilities from damage resulting from the development work.</p>
<p>If the plat is not in conformity with the Design and Development Standards of this Title, the DRC shall refer it back to the subdivider or developer with a list of items necessary to bring the plat into compliance. If the plat is in conformity, it will be submitted to the Planning Commission with suggestions and comments noted thereon. The Commission may continue the matter to further study the issues presented. The Commission may approve, deny or approve with conditions the proposed Preliminary Plat. If any conditions are attached, the Preliminary Plat shall be corrected to reflect such changes and an accurate Preliminary Plat shall be submitted to the City. Changes made in the Preliminary Plat by the DRC, Commission, or Council must be made before proceeding to the next step.</p>
<p>Receipt of this accurate copy shall be authorization for the developer to proceed with the preparation of plans and specifications for the minimum improvements hereinafter required by this Title and with the preparation of the Final Plat. Original Preliminary Plats are subject to the standards, policies, and regulations that are in effect at the time of approval for each of the Final Plats.</p>

<p>The purpose of impact fees is to provide necessary funding for capital improvements to public facilities incurred due to new development. Impact fees may be assessed for water, sewer, pressurized irrigation, electric power, storm drainage, streets and roads, recreation, and public safety.</p>
<div class="history">(Ord. No. 07-11, Amended 05/17/2011)</div>
<h3>15.4.12.030 Determination</h3>
<p>The Council may set impact fees based on studies and analyses of the anticipated costs to provide adequate public facilities to new developments. The amount of the impact fee shall not exceed the anticipated cost of providing adequate public facilities which become necessary as a result of the development. In setting the amount of the fee, the Council shall take into consideration the following factors:</p>
<p>The cost of existing capital facilities.</p>
<p>The manner of financing existing facilities.</p>
<p>The relative extent to which newly developed property and other properties within the City have already contributed to the costs of existing capital facilities.</p>
<p>The relative extent to which newly developed properties and other properties within the City will contribute to the cost of existing capital facilities in the future.</p>
<p>The relative extent to which newly developed properties are entitled to a credit because the City may be requiring owners or developers to provide common facilities that have historically been provided by the City and financed through general taxation or other charges in other parts of the City.</p>
<p>The extraordinary costs, if any, in servicing newly developed properties.</p>
<p>The time-price deferential inherent in fair comparison of amounts paid at different times.</p>
<h3>15.4.12.040 Method Of Assessing</h3>
<p>The Council may establish and assess impact fees by an impact fee enactment and by complying with the notice and hearing provisions of State law. For those impact fees due with a building permit, the fee in place on the date the permit was applied for will apply. For those impact fees due at plat recordation, the fees in place on the date of recording of the plat will apply.</p>

<h3>15.4.12.050 Special Exceptions</h3>
<p>The Council retains the authority to adjust any impact fee imposed in order to respond to unusual circumstances in specific cases and to ensure that impact fees are fairly imposed. Economic hardship shall not be considered an unusual circumstance justifying an adjustment to the impact fee.</p>
<p>The Council may, at its sole discretion, adjust any impact fee, on the basis of justice and equity, based upon studies and data submitted by the developer.</p>
<p>The Council may, at its sole discretion, waive any impact fee for governmental development or other development activities with broad public purposes. Any development undertaken to gain a profit, whether or not a profit is realized, does not qualify as a broad public purpose.</p>
<p>The Council may, at its sole discretion, allow a full or partial credit against impact fees for any system improvements provided by the developer that are required as a condition of approval of the development activity.</p>
<h3>15.4.12.060 Existing Structures</h3>
<p>Where the following conditions are met, credit will be given towards the impact fees for replacement structures:</p>
<p>The subject property was located within Spanish Fork City limits on July 1, 1995.</p>
<p>A dwelling or business was located on the subject property on July 1, 1995.</p>
<p>Municipal services such as water, sewer, or power were being provided to the subject property on July 1, 1995.</p>
<p>Credit towards impact fees will be limited to the services provided to the property for the existing service size.</p>
<div class="history">(Ord. No. 04-14, Enacted 04/01/2014)</div>
<h3>15.4.12.070 Reimbursable Projects</h3>
<p>Growth related infrastructure that does not have local connections shall be eligible for 100% reimbursement through impact fees. All roads along non-residential and multi-family development shall be considered to have local connection to the development. Parks shall not be considered to have local connection. If there are local connections, the difference between the regional and local infrastructure cost shall be eligible for reimbursement from impact fees. 600 amp electric lines are 28% reimbursable from impact fees. Roadway impact fee reimbursement shall only apply to improvements and land from back of curb to back of curb unless offsite along previously developed land. Intersection impact fee reimbursement shall be calculated by averaging the percent impact fee eligible of the two intersecting streets.</p>
<p>Eligible projects become reimbursable once they are added to the Impact Fee Facilities Plan (IFFP). The City Public Works Director will determine when projects will be added to the IFFP.</p>

<p>Approval of a Preliminary Plat or Site Plan shall not be granted until such time as the applicant has provided information, to the satisfaction of the City Engineer, to establish that adequate public facilities exist in the areas affected by the development to accommodate the development.</p>
<p>The public facilities to which the preceding paragraph applies shall include the following:</p>
<p>The City Culinary Water System, including quantity, quality, treatment, storage capacity, transmission capacity, and distribution capacity.</p>
<p>The City Sanitary Sewer System, including treatment, overall capacity, outfall lines, laterals, and collector lines.</p>

<h3>15.4.16.020 Unavailability Of Adequate Public Facilities</h3>
<p>In the event that the City Engineer determines that adequate public facilities are not available and will not be available by the time of approval, so as to assure that adequate public services are available at the time of occupancy, the following alternatives may be elected, at the discretion of the City Council:</p>
<p>Allowing the developer to voluntarily construct those public facilities which are necessary to service the proposed development and provide adequate facilities as determined by the City Engineer and by entering into an appropriate form of pioneering, or developers agreement, which may include, as deemed appropriate by the City Engineer, provisions for recoupment of any expenses incurred above and beyond those reasonably necessary for or related to the need created by or the benefit conferred upon the proposed development, and the method and conditions upon which recoupment is to be obtained. Any pioneering agreement authorized by this paragraph must be requested within 120 days of the completion and acceptance by the City of the improvements. The City Public Works Director may extend the deadline for up to one additional term upon good cause show.</p>
<p>Requiring the timing, sequencing, and phasing of the proposed development consistent with the availability of adequate public facilities.</p>
<p>Deferring approval and the issuance of building permits until all necessary public facilities are adequate and available.</p>
<p>Denying approval and allowing the applicant to reapply when adequate public facilities are available.</p>
<p>In the event the City installs infrastructure improvements which benefit specific properties, it may also recover reimbursement on a pro-rata basis from the benefitted properties when they develop, on the same basis as a developer would recover reimbursement with a pioneering agreement as set forth in paragraph A. A notice of pioneering intent may be recorded once the improvements are budgeted.</p>
<p>If an owner or developer plans to apply for a pioneering agreement at the conclusion of a project, the owner or developer shall submit a Notice of Pioneering Intent Application, pay the applicable fees, and post a bond for the pioneering infrastructure. The Public Works Director shall record a Notice of Pioneering Intent against the properties that will be benefitted by the pioneering infrastructure. The notice is not a lien on the property.</p>
<p>When a pioneering agreement is granted, or the City installs infrastructure for which it will be reimbursed, the Public Works Director shall record a Notice of Development Obligations against the benefitted properties so that a future owner/developer will be on notice of development costs associated with that parcel. The notice is not a lien on the property. The City is is not obligated to collect money for pioneering work if a Notice of Pioneering Intent or Notice of Development Obligations is not recorded or statutes or case law preclude the charging for the pioneering work.</p>
<p>Any Notice of Pioneering Intent shall be removed with the filing of a Notice of Development Obligation.</p>

Any waiver, variation, or substitution from the standards must be authorized in writing by the City Engineer or his/her designee. The expense of all such improvements and installations, including but not limited to expenses for all of the foregoing items and for area-wide topographical drainage, engineering, ecological or other work or study, shall be borne by the owner or subdivider or developer subject to such terms and conditions as may be required by the City Council by way of ordinance, resolution, contract, or otherwise. The failure of any owner or subdivider to comply with the terms of this provision or his/her failure to complete the installation of all of the foregoing installations, fixtures or improvements or such others as may be required by the City Council from time to time, shall result in the forfeiture pro tanto of the bond or other security posted. Any developer or subdivider forfeiting a bond may jeopardize his/her/its ability to do future projects in the City, following a hearing before the City Council. Any subdivision not in full compliance with this section shall not be connected to or receive any of its municipal services, including but not limited to water, sewer, irrigation, electricity, or refuse removal services.</p>

<h3>15.4.16.130 Landscaping, Buffering Walls, And Fences</h3>
<p>Purpose: It is in the public interest to enhance, conserve, and stabilize property values by encouraging pleasant and attractive landscapes and surroundings, providing proper separations between uses, conserving public water resources and promoting water efficient landscapes. The purpose of this chapter is to protect and enhance the environmental, economic, recreational, and aesthetic resources in Spanish Fork by promoting attractive properties by establishing standards and practices for the design, installation and maintenance of water efficient landscapes throughout the City.</p>
<p>Landscape Requirements for Single-family and Twin Home Residential Uses.</p>
<p>All single-family and twin home residential lots shall have the front yard, side-street yards for corner lots and park strips landscaped within one (1) year of receiving a Certificate of Occupancy. Interior side and back yards must be landscaped within two (2) years of receiving a Certificate of Occupancy.</p>
<p>All portions of a lot that are not improved with impervious materials must be landscaped within the above-described timelines. Weeds do not qualify as required landscaping. Landscaped areas shall be maintained in a neat, clean, and orderly condition. This includes the removal of litter, proper pruning, lawn mowing, weeding, dead-heading of perennial plants, fertilizing, replacement of dead plants, and regular watering of all landscaped areas.</p>
<p>Required landscaping in the park strips, front yards and side yards that are visible from the street shall be comprised of approved turf or live plant material with an automated irrigation system. Zero-scape may only be used in back yards that are not visible from the street. Water-conserving designs are encouraged (see §15.4.16.130(C) Water-Conserving Landscape Design Recommendations for Single-family and Twin Home Residential Uses).</p>
<p>Artificial turf is a synthetic ground cover designed to mimic the appearance of natural grass. It consists of fibers made from polypropylene, polyethylene, or a blend of these materials, tufted onto a backing material such as polypropylene or polyurethane. Artificial turf features lifelike blades with a minimum pile height of 1.5 inches and includes a mix of at least two shades of green and a thatch layer of beige or tan. Indoor or outdoor carpeting is not artificial turf and it is prohibited to use crumb rubber as infill material for artificial turf. Synthetic ground coverings installed for use as putting greens, bocce courts or for other similar activities are not considered artificial turf.  The use of artificial turf in park strips, front yards and side yards that are visible from the street is not permitted.  The use of artificial turf in front yards and side yards that are visible from the street is subject to the same area limitations that apply to the use of lawn.</p>
<p>No more than 70% of a lot shall be surfaced with impervious materials. No more than 60% of the front and side-street setback areas can be improved with impervious surfaces.</p>
<p>Where park strips are sufficiently wide, street trees are required in accordance with the provisions found in 12.08.</p>
<p>Lawn shall not be less than eight (8) feet wide at its narrowest point.</p>
<p>Lawn and artificial turf shall not exceed 35% of the front and side-yard landscape area. The landscape area does not include footprints of buildings or structures, sidewalks, typical driveways, and other non-irrigated areas intentionally left undeveloped.</p>
<p>Lawn and artificial turf shall not be installed in park strips. Lawn shall not be installed on paths, or on slopes greater than 25% or 4:1 grade.</p>
<p>Water-Conserving Landscape Design Recommendations for Single-family and Twin Home Residential Uses.</p>
<p>Water-conserving Landscape Design is encouraged. The Localscapes® Program, the Salt Lake City Plant List and Hydrozone Schedule 2013 prepared by Salt Lake City Public Utilities, and the Utah State University Center for Water-efficient Landscaping, shall be primary references for the design and installation of water-conserving plants and landscapes in Spanish Fork City (see Spanish Fork Water-Conserving Landscape Online Resource List at www.spanishfork.org). These and other resources included in the list offer user-friendly design ideas, recommendations, programs, examples and inspiration for the implementation of water-conserving landscapes for single-family and twin home uses, as well as those for developer/contractor installed projects.</p>
<p>The landscaped areas of the front yard, side and rear yards should follow Localscapes® five-step process as follows and as detailed in the Spanish Fork City Water-wise Landscape Design Elements &amp; Principles Guidebook (2022) and the Localscapes® Program (see Spanish Fork Water-Conserving Landscape Online Resource List at www.spanishfork.org).</p>
<p>Create a central open space in the front and rear yards consisting of lawn, hardscape, groundcover, gravel or compacted mulch.</p>
<p>Create smaller gathering areas constructed of hardscape shall be placed outside of the central open shape. In a landscape without lawn, gathering areas may function as the central open shape.</p>
<p>Fill remaining areas with planting beds composed of water-conserving plants and water-efficient irrigation systems.</p>
<p>Locate activity zones outside of the central open shape that are surfaced with materials other than lawn.</p>
<p>Provide paths and walkways to link the different areas of the yard together. These should be constructed of hardscape, mulch, other groundcover or non-lawn materials.</p>
<p>Landscape Requirements for Multi-family, Professional Office, Commercial and Industrial Uses.</p>
<p>The following standards shall be required for all new developer and contractor installed landscapes for the following project types:</p>
<p>Multi-family residential uses;</p>
<p>Professional Office and Non-residential or Non-commercial uses;</p>
<p>Commercial uses; and</p>
<p>Industrial uses.</p>
<p>The standards do not apply to single-family, twin home and similar residential uses (see Section C. General Landscape Requirements for Single-family and Twin Home Residential Uses).</p>
<p>The standards are not intended to conflict with other landscape requirements as defined by Utah law, including stormwater retention requirements and low-impact development guidelines. Notwithstanding these outdoor standards, whenever any requirement may conflict with Utah law, such conflicting requirements shall not apply.</p>
<p>At maturity, all applicable landscapes are required to have enough plant material (perennials, decorative grasses, shrubs, groundcovers and similar) to create at least 50% living plant cover at maturity at the ground plane, not including tree canopies.</p>
<p>General design requirements, the following describes the general landscape design requirements for each type of use.</p>

Each required landscape island shall include a single shade tree as identified on the City’s approved list of Street and Shade Trees (one (1) tree for single loaded, and two (2) trees for each merged double-loaded island). These trees shall count toward meeting the minimum required trees for the site.</p>
<p>Minimum 15-foot-wide planting area adjacent to all public streets, which shall include trees with a maximum spacing of 30 feet, which shall count toward meeting the minimum required trees for the site. The planting areas may be partially or completely within the street right-of-way area. The specific trees used shall be selected from the City’s approved Street and Shade Tree List. On streets included in the Shade Tree Master Plan, the trees selected shall include the mix of trees as prescribed by the Plan. Street and Shade trees must be planted within 30 feet of the public street curb, and wherever possible, 50% of the required Street and Shade Trees must be planted in the park strip.  These trees shall count toward meeting up to 50% of the minimum number of required trees for the site based on the amount of required landscaping.</p>
<p>A minimum 10 foot wide planting buffer and a six (6) foot decorative wall are required where any multi-family use abuts another property. These trees shall count toward meeting the minimum required trees for the site. An exception to the six (6) foot decorative wall requirement may be granted if the Development Review Committee finds that the multi-family use and adjacent uses are designed to create an integrated campus-like environment. In such cases, the planter area shall include shade trees are spaced a maximum of 30 feet apart.</p>
<p>In cases where it is determined that the tree species in the approved Street and Shade Tree List (see Appendix X) would adversely impact utility lines and public infrastructure, the use of substitute tree species may be approved by the Community Development Director.</p>

<p>E. Landscape Requirements for Multi-family and Non-residential Uses.</p>
<p>1. General Requirements</p>
<p>a. All irrigation systems shall be appropriate for the designated plant material to achieve the highest water efficiency. Drip irrigation and bubbler systems shall be used in all landscape areas except those that contain lawn. Drip irrigation systems shall be equipped with a pressure regulator, filter, flush-end assembly, and any other appropriate components.</p>

Lawn and planting beds shall be irrigated on separate irrigation valves. In addition, drip emitters and sprinklers shall be placed on separate irrigation valves.</p>
<p>c. At least three to four (3-4) inches of mulch, permeable to air and water, shall be used in planting beds to control weeds and improve the appearance of the landscaping.</p>
<p>d. At maturity, single-family landscapes are recommended to have enough plant material (perennials and shrubs) to create at least 50% living plant cover at maturity at the ground plane, not including tree canopies.</p>
<p>e. At maturity, multi-family and non-residential landscapes are required to have enough plant material (perennials and shrubs) to create at least 50% living plant cover at maturity at the ground plane, not including tree canopies.</p>
<p>f. Lawn and artificial turf  should not be installed in park strips. Lawn should not be installed on paths less than eight (8) feet in width, or on slopes greater than 25% or 4:1 gradient.</p>
<p>2. Trees.</p>
<p>a. Purpose. The planting and growth of healthy trees contribute to making Spanish Fork an attractive and healthy community. Planting the correct type of tree in the right setting is an important factor for ensuring Spanish Fork will continue to be an attractive and resilient city in the future. Landscape design and implementation practices are therefore required to ensure existing trees are preserved to the greatest degree possible, and that newly planted trees survive and thrive. This is particularly important for street trees and trees located in the highly-visible front yards of all properties in the city. The purpose of this section is to define permitted and prohibited trees for use in Spanish Fork and to identify the standards that apply to the selection and planting of correct trees in different locations.</p>
<p>b. Tree Selection and Standards</p>
<p>Planting the right type of tree in the correct setting is an important factor for ensuring that Spanish Fork will continue to be an attractive and resilient city in the future. This is a function of the specific location where the tree is planted, and the size of the soil/planting area, as described below and detailed in the Spanish Fork Approved Street and Shade Tree List. In addition to those requirements, tree restrictions may be subject to requirements of other government agencies (UDOT, for example) and utilities with below and above-ground electrical, gas and cable services. In order to accomplish this, the following standards and practices shall be required.</p>
<p>i. Selection and planting of street trees contained in the Spanish Fork Approved Street and Shade Tree List.</p>
<p>ii. Existing trees should be preserved whenever possible.</p>
<p>iii. When removing vegetation and plantings around the trunks and bases of existing trees when installing water efficient landscapes, special care should be taken to not damage the roots of existing trees.</p>
<p>iv. Newly planted trees need additional water during the first years of planting in order to become established. In addition to properly designed irrigation systems, other methods such as drip hoses and “gator bags” should be used to provide more water for new trees, particularly when irrigation water is unavailable.</p>
<p>v. Street trees shall be selected based on a combination of their approximate size at maturity, Tree Size at maturity as follow:</p>
<p>Large Trees –45 feet tall or greater at maturity;</p>
<p>Medium Trees –30-45 feet tall at maturity;</p>
<p>Small Trees – less than 30 feet tall at maturity.</p>
<p>vi. Nursery Stock Specifications - trees should be grown in a recognized nursery in accordance with good horticultural practice (American Association of Nurseryman Standards, ANSI Z60.1, as amended, or similar). Trees should be healthy, vigorous stock grown under climatic conditions similar to the locality of the project and free of disease, insects, eggs, larvae, and defects such as knots, sun-scale, injuries, abrasions, or disfigurement.</p>
<p>vii. Minimum Tree Size: the minimum size of all deciduous trees shall be two (2) inch caliper minimum, measured as provided in the American Association of Nurseryman Standards, ANSI Z60.1, as amended, or similar. Evergreen trees shall be not less than six (6) feet in height, measured from ground level, unless approved in writing by the Community Development Director.</p>
<p>viii. Permitted Trees - General</p>
<p>Large Planting Areas: Select from the Large Tree List. Planting area width shall be a minimum of 10 feet wide, which is generally sufficient to accommodate large trees with maximum size, shade and energy conservation benefits, while providing space for root and branch growth that will not conflict with site features;</p>
<p>Medium Planting Areas: Select from the Medium Tree List. Planting area width shall be a minimum of eight (8) feet wide, which is generally sufficient to accommodate medium size trees while providing space for root and branch growth that will not conflict with site features;</p>
<p>Small Planting Areas: Select trees from the Small Tree List. Planting area width shall be no smaller than six (6) feet, which is considered the absolute minimum space necessary to accommodate small size trees.</p>

<p>See Prohibited Tree List.</p>
<p>d. Street Trees and Park Strip Design</p>
<p>See Spanish Fork Approved Street and Shade Tree List  and other requirements.</p>
<p>Park strips shall be designed as part of the adjacent use and landscape treatment.</p>
<p>3. Other Standards, Requirements and Maintenance Considerations</p>
<p>a. Artificial turf is a synthetic ground cover designed to mimic the appearance of natural grass. It consists of fibers made from polypropylene, polyethylene, or a blend of these materials, tufted onto a backing material such as polypropylene or polyurethane. Artificial turf features lifelike blades with a minimum pile height of 1.5 inches and includes a mix of at least two shades of green and a thatch layer of beige or tan. Indoor or outdoor carpeting is not artificial turf and it is prohibited to use crumb rubber as infill material for artificial turf. Synthetic ground coverings installed for use as putting greens, bocce courts or for other similar activities are not considered artificial turf. The use of artificial turf in front yards and side yards that are visible from the street is subject to the same area limitations that apply to the use of lawn.</p>
<p>b. Zero-scape is a landscape design method that eliminates the need for irrigation water by eliminating plants from the landscape. Zero-scape landscapes are typified by yards and landscape areas covered with pavement, other paving and hardscape materials, gravel, rock and stone. Zero-scape landscapes treatments in park strips, front yards and side yards that are visible from the street do not meet the goals of creating an attractive and livable city and are not permitted in Spanish Fork City.</p>
<p>c. Shrubs over five feet in height and/or-width at maturity shall be five (5) gallons minimum when planted. Smaller shrubs, ground covers, perennials, forbs and decorative grasses shall be one (1) gallon size minimum when planted.</p>
<p>d. Planting areas shall be separated from parking areas and driveways by a raised six (6) inch concrete curb.</p>
<p>e. Landscaped areas shall be maintained in a neat, clean, and orderly condition. This includes the removal of litter, proper pruning, lawn mowing, weeding, deadheading for perennial plants, fertilizing, replacement of dead plants, and regular watering of all landscaped areas.</p>
<p>f. The Community Development Director may waive, at their discretion, the size requirements for required landscaping provided that the developer provides financial assurance that the landscaping will survive or be replaced after the first two (2) growing seasons. Trees and bushes shall be replaced after the first two (2) growing seasons if they die or fail to reach the minimum required size by October 15 of the second year after the landscaping was installed and inspected by the City</p>
<p>F. Plan Review, Construction Inspection and Post-Construction Monitoring</p>
<p>As part of the site plan or subdivision application, a copy of the required landscape plan documentation package shall be submitted to the city for review and approval before a permit shall be issued and construction begins.</p>
<p>All landscape plan documentation packages submitted must be stamped by a professionally licensed landscape architect (PLA).</p>
<p>All installers, designers and auditors shall meet State and local license, insurance, and bonding requirements, and be able to show proof of such.</p>
<p>During construction, site inspection may be performed by the Community Development Department.</p>
<p>A guarantee of the installation of required improvements shall be made to the City in the form of a deposit for the estimated cost of required work at the time of building permit issuance.</p>
<p>Spanish Fork City reserves the right to perform site inspections at any time before, during or after the irrigation system and landscape installation, and to require corrective measures if requirements of this chapter are not satisfied.</p>

<h3>15.4.16.170 Hillside Development</h3>
<p>Introduction. The procedures contained in this section are provided to give direction to consultants as to when slope stability analysis should be completed and minimum general guidelines for completing the analysis. Additional effort above and beyond these requirements may be required based on site specific constraints and characteristics.</p>
<p>Purpose and Intent. The standards, guidelines and criteria of this section are intended to:</p>
<p>Protect the public from flooding, erosion and other environmental hazards that may result from the development of sensitive hillsides;</p>
<p>Minimize the threat and consequential damage of fire in hillside areas;</p>
<p>Preserve natural vegetation, geologic features, wildlife habitat and open space;</p>
<p>Minimize the amount of grading and earthwork, including street excavation and site grading;</p>
<p>Design and construct roads, where necessary, in such a way as to minimize scars from cuts and fills and to avoid permanent scarring of hillsides and other sensitive land areas, and to make them easily accessible for fire protection, snow removal, school buses, and emergency vehicles; and</p>
<p>Preserve and enhance visual and environmental quality.</p>
<p>Slopes. Any land or parcel having a slope greater than or equal to 3H:1V shall be deemed to be land having a "steep slope" within the meaning of this section. Close proximity to a steep slope shall be defined as the horizontal distance from the slope which is less than or equal to the vertical distance from the crest of the slope to the toe of the slope. No person shall be permitted to grade, excavate, fill, erect any structure, or otherwise disturb an undisturbed hillside area that exceeds a 3H:1V slope. Any person proposing to grade, excavate, fill or to erect any structure on any slope or hillside with a slope between 4H:1V and 3H:1V or within close proximity to a slope greater than or equal to 4H:1V, shall be required to submit a site-specific geotechnical report with a slope stability analysis. Other areas that require a slope stability analysis are discussed in paragraph H below. The City will have that report reviewed by its own geotechnical engineer. The cost of that review will be borne by the applicant.</p>
<p>Prior to any excavation, cutting, or filling on slopes in excess of 10H:1V, a land disturbance permit shall be obtained from the City. Prior to issuing the permit, the City will have qualified professionals review the plans to ensure public safety and to take precautions against potential slides. The type and number of professionals will be determined by the City Engineer on a case by case basis. The cost of the professional review will be borne by the applicant. In no case will construction be allowed in, above, below, or laterally within 200 feet of a landslide, debris flow, or potential debris flow.</p>
<p>Cut and fill slopes shall be constructed to eliminate sharp angles of intersection with the existing terrain and shall be rounded and contoured as necessary to blend with existing topography to the maximum extent possible, as determined in the sole discretion of the City Engineer. The City will not accept the dedication and maintenance of cut and fill slopes except those within the required street right-of-way. Maintenance of cut and fill slopes outside of street rights-of-way are the responsibility of the individual property owner. Where a cut or fill slope occurs between two (2) lots, the slope shall normally be made a part of the downhill lot. Cut and fill slopes shall not be allowed to disrupt existing drainage channels.</p>
<p>The current version of the Building Code adopted by the Utah Uniform Building Code Commission regulating excavation and grading shall be complied with.</p>
<p>Building Sites. Each building lot shall contain a buildable area of not less than 4,000 square feet with a natural slope that is less than 3H:1V. The buildable area shall have minimum length and depth dimensions of 50 feet.</p>
<p>No structure, primary or accessory, shall be located within 20 feet of a 3H:1V slope. No slope in excess of 10H:1V shall be disrupted without first obtaining a land disturbance permit, described in paragraph D.</p>
<p>An exception to these building site requirements is granted for existing building lots in platted and recorded subdivisions, provided that each lot, prior to construction, provide the geotechnical report required in paragraph A, and as described in more detail in the Construction Standards.</p>
<p>Drainage. Required storm water runoff collection facilities shall be designed so as to retain storm water runoff on development sites for a sufficient length of time so as to prevent flooding and erosion during storm water runoff flow periods. Retainage amounts and times shall mirror historical amounts and times. Required storm water runoff collection facilities shall be so designed as to divert surface water away from natural slopes, cut faces, or sloping surfaces of a fill. French drains are not acceptable.</p>
<p>Storm water detention or retention facilities should not be placed near the crest of natural or manmade slopes.</p>
<p>Curb, gutter, and pavement designs shall be such that water on roadways is prevented from flowing off the roadways.</p>
<p>Natural drainage shall be rip-rapped or otherwise stabilized to the satisfaction of the City Engineer below drainage and culvert discharge points for a distance sufficient to convey the discharge without channel erosion.</p>
<p>Waste material from construction, including soil and other solid materials, shall not be deposited within a natural or manmade drainage course nor within irrigation channels.</p>
<p>Sediment catchment ponds shall be constructed downstream from each development, unless sediment retention facilities are otherwise provided.</p>
<p>Vegetation and Revegetation. Every effort shall be made to conserve topsoil which is removed during construction for later use on areas requiring vegetation or landscaping, e.g., cut and fill slopes.</p>
<p>Areas not contained within lot boundaries shall be protected with adapted, fire-resistant species of perennial vegetation cover after all construction is completed. New planting shall be protected with organic cover.</p>
<p>All disturbed soil surfaces shall be stabilized before final acceptance of the development by the City. The developer shall be fully responsible for any destruction of native vegetation which is required to be retained in all areas under the ownership and control of the developer. The developer shall carry the responsibility for such areas both for the developer’s own employees and for all subcontractors from the first day of construction until final acceptance of the development by the City. The developer shall be responsible for replacing such destroyed vegetation.</p>
<p>Prior to the termination of the development improvements bond, any dead plant materials required to be installed by the developer shall be replaced and a new bond issued to assure establishment of the replaced materials.</p>
<p>Areas Requiring Slope Stability Analysis. Slope stability analysis shall be performed for all sites meeting the following criteria:</p>
<p>Cut or fill slopes at or steeper than 3H:1V and 20 feet or taller in vertical height.</p>
<p>Natural slopes at or greater than 4H:1V but less than 3H:1V, and 20 feet or taller in vertical height. Natural slopes at or steeper than 3H:1V shall not be disturbed without the Development Review Committee’s approval. A slope exceeding 3H:1V may be disturbed if the hillside is determined to have existing, potentially adverse geologic conditions, in which case the City Engineer or his/her designee may approve remediation efforts.</p>
<p>Natural and cut slopes with potentially adverse geologic conditions such as bedding, foliation, or other features that could present slope stability issues.</p>
<p>Natural and engineered slopes that are potentially impacted by a geologic hazard such as a landslide, irrespective of the slope height or gradient.</p>
<p>Buttresses and stability fills.</p>
<p>Cut, fill or natural slopes for water retention basins or flood-control channels.</p>
<p>Slope Stability Analysis Requirements.</p>
<p>Slope stability analyses should consider off-property conditions above and below the slope being evaluated. Analysis should demonstrate that the proposed hillside development will not affect adjacent sites or limit adjacent property owner’s ability to develop their site.</p>
<p>A licensed, experienced geotechnical engineer and licensed, experienced geologist should be used to complete all slope stability analyses. The geologist and geotechnical engineer should collaborate their efforts to develop a rational subsurface model, ground motion parameters and soil strengths. The geotechnical engineer should perform the stability calculations, the geologist shall interpret geologic data and prepare the subsurface model (geologic cross section), and both shall stamp the final report.</p>
<p>Except for the derivation of the input ground motion for pseudo-static and seismic deformation analyses, slope stability analysis and evaluations should be performed in general accordance with Recommended Procedures for Implementation of DMG Special Publication 117, Guidelines for Analyzing and Mitigating Landslide Hazards in California (Blake et al. 2002).</p>
<p>Static and pseudo-static slope stability should be completed using limit-equilibrium software such as SLIDE, SLOPE/W or another similar program. Analysis method chosen (circular, block, etc.) should be best suited toward the specific site and geologic conditions. Subsurface conditions in the model should represent worst-case anticipated conditions with regards to groundwater elevation and moisture content characteristics of the soil.</p>
<p>Design ground motions for use in the pseudo-static and seismic deformation analysis should be based on the PGA as determined from probabilistic analysis for the maximum credible earthquake (MCE), with spectral acceleration factored for site conditions in accordance with the currently adopted IBC. Seismic analysis of a slope may be performed using the pseudo-approach. An appropriate seismic coefficient should be selected based on a rational approach, such as Blake et. al 2002, Hynes and Franklin 1984, or a similar published and generally accepted procedure. A rational basis for selection of seismic coefficient (e.g. probabilistic ground motion, Site Class, etc.) shall be clearly presented in the final report.</p>
<p>For situations where unacceptable factors of safety are determined or when the site contains other constraints such as long shallow failures, a permanent slope deformation analysis should be performed. Estimates of permanent seismic displacement should be performed using the procedures outlined in Bray and Travesarou (2007). For this and other screening procedures, the calculated seismic displacements shall be 5 cm or less for a slope or proposed mitigation measure.</p>
<p>The minimum acceptable factor of safety for static slope stability is 1.5. The minimum acceptable factor of safety for pseudo-static slope stability is 1.0. These are the minimums required by the City; based on actual conditions and the uncertainties associated with the site, the Geotechnical Engineer may select higher factors of safety, as deemed appropriate.</p>
<p>Adequate evaluation of slope stability for a given site requires a thorough and comprehensive geologic and geotechnical engineering investigation. The investigation should include but may not be limited to the following; review of available published geologic information (including maps, reports, and historic air photos), geologic field mapping, subsurface exploration, groundwater elevation determination and accurate soil profile characterization. Borings should extend to a depth of at least ¾ of the height of the slope at a minimum and preferably the full height of the slope (this requirement may be waived if the geology is clearly exposed on the slope face). Deeper borings may be required based on the site conditions and proposed construction. Test pits may be allowed, particularly for shorter slopes, if access can be obtained to allow placement of the test pits near the top, bottom and middle of the slope so as to provide an accurate characterization of the soil profile, and geologic conditions allow a reasonable geologic interpretation of the entire slope based on the earth materials exposed in the test pits.</p>
<p>Accurate soil parameters are critical to providing a reliable slope stability analysis. Samples should be obtained from each soil strata of reasonably different engineering characteristics and appropriate laboratory tests completed to determine parameters for shear strength (friction angle and cohesion) and unit weight for each layer. In the case of landslide deposits tests to assess residual shear strengths should be performed in suspected shear zones to obtain accurate soil information. Direct shear, ring shear, simple shear, or triaxial shear tests (as appropriate) should be completed to obtain shear strength parameters. For unconsolidated granular soils, in-situ testing (e.g. SPT, CPT) may also be used to develop soil strength profiles.</p>
<p>Streets and Driveways. All streets within a hillside area shall be designed to meet the standards required for streets in all other areas of the City. Street and driveway grades shall not exceed 8%, unless authorized by the City Engineer. The City Engineer may not authorize street or driveway grades in excess of 12%.</p>
<p>Submittals. Submittals for review shall include report text that should contain a summary of the analysis along with conclusions and recommendations based on the data presented. As a minimum, all reports should include the following element:</p>
<p>Slope stability modeling – basis for model, input data, and graphic output.</p>
<p>Boring and/or test pit logs.</p>
<p>Geologic cross sections prepared by a licensed geologist (graphic output from a limit equilibrium software will not be accepted as a substitute for a geologic cross section). Subsurface geologic and groundwater conditions must be illustrated on geologic cross sections and must be utilized by the Geotechnical Engineer for the slope stability analyses.</p>
<p>A local geology map presenting the results of field mapping and literature review. The map should be prepared at an appropriate scale (generally no smaller than 1”=100’, larger is preferred), and should show geologic units, geologic structures/orientations, proposed and existing grades, and the location of the geologic cross-sections.</p>
<p>Laboratory data including shear strength plots.</p>
<p>Computer input and output files for the slope stability analysis.</p>
<p>Fire Protection. Lot size and potential placement of buildings thereon shall be such that adequate clearance from combustible materials is provided, as determined by the City’s Fire Marshal.</p>
<p>All easements for firebreaks for safety of built-up areas shall encompass access for firefighting personnel and equipment and such easements shall be dedicated for this specific purpose by being recorded with the plat, or by easement if there is no plat.</p>
<p>The inability to provide water pressure at fire hydrants consistent with the standards set by the Insurance Service Organization for fighting fires shall be justification for denial of a development request.</p>

<p>15.4.20 Flood Damage Prevention</p>
<h3>15.4.20.010 Statutory Authorization, Findings Of Fact, And Purpose And Methods</h3>
<h3>15.4.20.020 Definitions</h3>
<h3>15.4.20.030 General Provisions</h3>
<h3>15.4.20.0400 Administration</h3>
<h3>15.4.20.050 Provisions For Flood Hazard Reduction</h3>
<h3>15.4.20.010 Statutory Authorization, Findings Of Fact, And Purpose And Methods</h3>
<p>Statutory Authorization. The City of Spanish Fork elects to comply with the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (P.L. 90-488, as amended). The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is a voluntary program administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), a component of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and City of Spanish Fork community officials have elected to join the program, participate, and enforce this Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance and the requirements and regulations of the NFIP. The NFIP, established in the aforesaid act, provides that areas of the City of Spanish Fork having a special flood hazard be identified by FEMA, and that floodplain management measures be applied in such flood hazard areas. Furthermore, City of Spanish Fork may elect to administer the Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance to areas not identified as Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs) by FEMA on the community’s effective Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), if the community has documentation to support that there is an inherent risk of flooding in such areas.</p>
<p>Finding of Fact</p>
<p>The flood hazard areas of the City of Spanish Fork are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.</p>
<p>These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains that cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazards areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage.</p>
<p>Statement of Purpose.  It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:</p>
<p>Protect human life and health;</p>
<p>Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood-control projects;</p>
<p>Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding that are generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;</p>
<p>Minimize prolonged business interruptions;</p>
<p>Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water and sewer mains, electric and telephone lines, and streets and bridges located in floodplains.</p>
<p>Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize blight to future flood-prone areas;</p>
<p>Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.</p>
<p>Methods of Reducing Flood Losses. In order to accomplish its purposes, this ordinance uses the following methods:</p>
<p>Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities;</p>
<p>Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;</p>
<p>Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters;</p>
<p>Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage;</p>
<p>Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.</p>

The City Engineer or his/her appointee is hereby appointed the Floodplain Administrator and implement the provisions of this ordinance and other appropriate sections of 44 CFR (National Flood Insurance Program Regulations) pertaining to floodplain management.</p>
<p>Duties and Responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator. Duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator shall include, but not be limited to, the following:</p>
<p>Maintain and hold open for public inspection all records pertaining to the provisions of this ordinance.</p>
<p>Review permit application to determine whether proposed building site, including the placement of manufactured homes, will be reasonably safe from flooding.</p>
<p>Review, approve or deny all applications for development permits required by adoption of this ordinance.</p>
<p>Review permits for proposed development to assure that all necessary permits have been obtained from those Federal, State or local governmental agencies (including Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1334) from which prior approval is required.</p>
<p>Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions) the Floodplain Administrator shall make the necessary interpretation.</p>
<p>Notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities and the State Coordinating Agency which is State Engineer’s office, prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.</p>
<p>Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of any watercourse is maintained.</p>
<p>When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance, the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation data and floodway data available from a Federal, State or other source, in order to administer the provisions of this ordinance.</p>
<p>When a regulatory floodway has not been designated, the Floodplain Administrator must require that no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE on the community's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community.</p>
<p>Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations, a community may approve certain development in Zones A1-30, AE, AH, on the community's FIRM which increases the water surface elevation of the base flood by more than one foot, provided that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM revision through FEMA (Conditional Letter of Map Revision).</p>
<p>Permit Procedures. Application for a preliminary plat, site plan, or building permit within a special floodplain hazard area shall be presented to the Floodplain Administrator on forms furnished by him/her and may include, but not be limited to, plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the location, dimensions, and elevation of proposed landscape alterations, existing and proposed structures,  including the placement of manufactured homes, and the construction fences, and the location of the foregoing in relation to areas of special flood hazard  and areas of special erosion hazard.</p>
<p>Additionally, the following information is required:</p>
<p>Elevation (in relation to mean sea level), of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new and substantially improved structures;</p>
<p>Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any nonresidential structure shall be floodproofed;</p>

<p>Description of the extent to which any watercourse or natural drainage will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development.</p>
<p>A bank stability/erosion hazard analysis performed by a licensed professional engineer, including site photographs, that evaluates potential flood-related erosion hazards and identifies appropriate erosion hazard mitigation measures to protect any structural improvements proposed in the area of special erosion hazard.</p>
<p>A geotechnical report that includes: at least one measurement of the ambient groundwater surface elevation on the site of proposed development collected between May 1 and May 31 (unless otherwise approved by the Floodplain Administrator); an engineer' s estimate of the  maximum anticipated groundwater elevation anticipated on the site during periods of flooding on the Spanish Fork River, referencing nearby base flood elevations on the current FIRM and all other available sources; and an engineer's recommendation with regard to the lowest elevation(s) that the lowest floor(s) (including basement) of all new and  substantially improved structures should be constructed to be protected from flooding from groundwater and groundwater that could be influenced by surface water during periods of flooding.</p>
<p>A grading permit shall be obtained from the Floodplain Administrator before any excavation or fill work that could modify the flood hazards defined on the community's FIRM is completed in the area of special erosion hazard area.</p>
<p>Maintain records of all such information.</p>
<p>Flood Plain Permit Approval or Denial.  Approval or denial of a preliminary plat, site plan, or any permit required by shall be based on all of the  provisions of this ordinance and the following relevant factors:</p>
<p>The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;</p>
<p>The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;</p>
<p>The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;</p>
<p>The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;</p>
<p>The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;</p>
<p>The cost of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of streets and bridges, and public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems;</p>
<p>The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters and  the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site;</p>
<p>The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use; and</p>
<p>The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan for that area.</p>
<p>Variance Procedures. The City Council shall act as the appeal authority and shall hear and render judgment on requests for variances from the requirements of this ordinance.</p>
<p>Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the City Council may appeal such decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all actions involving an appeal and shall report variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the State Office of Emergency Management upon issuing a variance.</p>
<p>Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in Section C of this Article have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.</p>
<p>Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this ordinance, the City Council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this ordinance.</p>
<p>Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.</p>
<p>Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.</p>
<p>Prerequisites for granting variances:</p>
<p>Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.</p>
<p>Variances shall only be issues upon:</p>
<p>showing a good and sufficient cause;</p>
<p>a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and</p>
<p>a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.</p>
<p>Any application to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.</p>
<p>Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that:</p>
<p>the criteria outlined in Section 15.4.20.040(D)(1)-(10) are met, and</p>
<p>the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.</p>

<p>All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage.</p>
<p>Standards for Areas of Shallow Flooding (AO/AH Zones)</p>
<p>Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in Section 15.4.20.030(B), are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of 1 to 3 feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply:</p>
<p>All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified).</p>
<p>All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential structures</p>
<p>have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified), or;</p>
<p>together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy.</p>
<p>A registered professional engineer shall submit a certification to the Floodplain Administrator that the standards of Section 15.4.20.040(C) are satisfied.</p>
<p>Require within Zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures.</p>
<p>FIRMs may also identify areas of shallow flooding hazards with an average depth less than 1 foot deep (shaded Zone X). These areas may be between the flood hazard boundaries defined for the 1- and 0.2-percentchance-annual-flood or associated with base flood depths less than 1 foot where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity may be evident. Such flooding is generally characterized by sheet flow. Therefore, the following provisions apply for all new construction or substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures:</p>
<p>All new construction or substantial improvements have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the estimated depth of the base flood and above the highest groundwater level that is anticipated to occur during periods of flooding.</p>
<p>Require within shaded X Zones positive ground slopes away from structures and adequate drainage paths around structures on sloping ground to guide flood water around and away from proposed structures.</p>
<p>A registered professional engineer shall submit certification to the Floodplain Administrator that the standards of this Section. as proposed is satisfied.</p>
<p>Floodways</p>
<p>Floodways located within areas of special flood hazard established in 15.4.20.030, are extremely hazardous areas due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply:</p>
<p>Designate a regulatory floodway which will not increase the Base Flood level more than 1 foot.</p>
<p>Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.</p>
<p>All new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Section 15.4.20.050 in this ordinance.</p>
<p>Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Regulations, a community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM and floodway revision through FEMA.</p>
<p>Standard for Areas of Special Erosion Hazard</p>
<p>In order to prevent damage to structures in areas subject to special erosion hazards, the following provisions shall apply.</p>
<p>No structural development will be allowed to be constructed in an area of special erosion hazard unless the potential erosion hazards have been evaluated and mitigated and buildings meet minimum setback requirements in subsection (B)(6) of this section.</p>
<p>No excavation or fill that could modify flood hazard boundaries defined on the FIRM shall be performed in areas of special erosion hazard without a grading permit, in accordance with (B)(6) of this section.</p>
<p>No solid walls, solid fences, or other structures that could disrupt flowing water in an area of special flood hazard or special erosion hazard shall be constructed in a position or direction contrary to the direction of flowing water to create additional flooding and erosion hazards.</p>
<p>Penalties for Violation</p>
<p>No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this ordinance and other applicable regulations. Violation of the provisions of this ordinance by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a Class C misdemeanor and shall be punished as provided in Section 1.16.010 of the Spanish Fork Municipal Code, for each violation. In addition, a person who violates this ordinance shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Nothing herein contained shall prevent Spanish Fork City from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.</p>
