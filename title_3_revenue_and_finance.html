    <p>H. Construction Management and General Contracting (CM/GC). This Process is an integrated approach to planning, design, and construction. City, designer(s), and contractor(s) work collaboratively to develop the project scope, optimize the design, improve quality, manage costs and share risks. Project delivery method consists of two phases-design and construction. When the City considers the design to be complete the contractor then has the opportunity to bid on the project based on the completed design and schedule. Except as otherwise specified here, all provisions outlined in the City’s 3.08 Purchasing Policy shall apply to said contract.</p>
    <p>1. Goal. The objective of CM/GC (Construction Manager/General Contractor) should prioritize equitable treatment for all involved parties, ensuring fairness and equality, while streamlining design and procurement activities. It aims to foster effective, wide-reaching competition. The City seeks optimal value, aiming for on-time project completion, adherence to budget, maintaining high-quality standards, and ensuring safe construction practices.</p>
    <p>2. Development of Project Goals. The Project Team should identify goals in coordination with an oversight committee comprised of an elected official, department director, finance director, city engineer, project manager and any other appropriate personnel required. These goals should be concise and generally based on scope, schedule, budget, quality and impacts to the public.</p>
    <p>3. Develop a Request for Proposal (RFP) and Evaluation Manual. Use the RFP method outlined in 3.08.040(F). Generally, the CM/GC RFP Template shall be used</p>
    <p>4. Procurement. CM/GC shall procure its first tier subcontractors using one of the source selection methods outlined in this Policy.</p>
    <p>5.Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP). The CM/GC shall provide the City with a GMP which is the final price that the CM/GC agrees to accept in full performance of a Construction Manager/General Contractor Agreement (CM/GC Agreement) and is based on the final contract drawings and specifications. The GMP shall include all fees and percentages required by this RFP, as well as the costs for general conditions and all work as required in the Contract Documents.</p>
    <p>Work may be completed in project phases and separate bid packages. The successful CM/GC will be required to submit a GMP for each of these phases and packages. The sum or total of all the phases shall be the final GMP. The final GMP is normally determined at the completion of the contract documents and receipt of subcontractor’s bids. However, a GMP may be negotiated at an earlier point as may be needed by the City.</p>
    <p>The CM/GC is not allowed to proceed into construction unless the City agrees that the GMP provided, as part of a guarantee to complete the project, or a portion of the project, is fair and reasonable. If the City determines it is in its best interest and/or that the GMP is not fair or reasonable, the city may put the project out to a formal bid. The contractor's GMP shall be used as their submitted bid price.</p>
    <p>F. CM/GC GMP Contingency. At the sole discretion of the City, during the finalization of the GMP, a specific sum of funds may be earmarked for inclusion in the GMP as a GMP Contingency. This allocation will be clearly defined within the Final GMP, specifically tailored to address elements of work identified in that particular GMP.</p>
    <p>The CM/GC GMP Contingency is intended for the following:</p>
    <p>1. Design or modifications not represented in construction documents used as the basis of fee (e.g., costs arising from design alterations between 90% design completion and the CM/GC contract award);</p>
    <p>2. Quantity Overruns;</p>
    <p>3. Minor design changes authorized by the City;</p>
    <p>4. Identified Risks;</p>
    <p>5. Shared Risk Items.</p>
    <p>The CM/GC must indicate on the CM/GC Project Cost Form their proposed percentage of the Project construction costs for this CM/GC GMP Contingency (e.g., 5%, 10%, etc.). All unused portions of the CM/GC GMP Contingency shall revert back to the City.</p>
    <p>G. Owner-controlled Contingency. At the sole discretion of the City, an overall Project budgeting reserve (a.k.a. Owner-controlled Contingency) may be held and maintained exclusive from the CM/GC Project costs and GMP. This Owner-controlled Contingency, if held, will be in an amount, determined by the City, and inclusive in the overall Project budget, to properly account for potential increased cost due to changes in the work, made at the discretion of the City, that were not anticipated by the City and are beyond the control of the City and or the CM/GC at the start of the program and for possible cost escalation(s), if any.</p>
    <p>The Owner-controlled Contingency is a fund allocation intended to cover the following:</p>
    <p>1. Owner-directed design or scope changes;</p>
    <p>2. Design errors or omissions;</p>
    <p>3. Unforeseen conditions not noted in CM/GC GMP Contingency;</p>
    <p>4. Possible cost escalations, if any.</p>
    <p>The City will indicate a proposed percentage of the Project construction costs for this Owner-controlled Contingency.</p>
    <p>H. Insurance and Bonds. As a contract is awarded and then proceeds, the CM/GC must furnish the City with all appropriate Bonds and Insurance as required by the Contract Documents, including but not limited to appropriate insurance, Bid Bond(s), Performance Bond(s), Payment Bond(s), etc.</p>
    <p>I. Contract Documents. CM/GC Contract Template shall be used and must be approved by the City.</p>

    <p>Change Orders. The maximum allowable markup for overhead and profit for a change order is 10%. Change orders which increase the contract price in an amount less than the greater of $35,000 or 10% of the contract amount may be approved by the City Finance Director provided further that the sum of all change orders do not increase the contract price by more than the greater of $50,000 or 15% of the contract amount.</p>

Where a bid exceeds available funds and time or economic considerations preclude re-solicitation of work or purchase of a reduced scope or quantity, the City Finance Director may negotiate an adjustment of the bid price, including changes in the bid requirements, with the lowest responsible bidder, in order to bring the low bid within the amount of available funds.</p>
    <p>Rejection of Bids. The City Finance Director may, in his or her own discretion, reject any and all bids presented, and may re-advertise for bids as set forth in this Article.</p>
    <p>Single Bids. The City Finance Director may require a price or cost analysis if only one bid is received. The bidder may be required to furnish a detailed cost proposal, and the bid award shall be subject to subsequent negotiation.</p>

    <p>Used Supplies and Materials. The City may acquire used supplies without following formal purchasing procedures if the Finance Director determines that there is an established market price for the used supplies and that it is beneficial for the City to acquire the used supplies.</p>
