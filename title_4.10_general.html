In areas that are windy at night it is better to water during the day. The wind will evaporate water much faster than the sun. Please see the Nighttime Wind Boundary Map on the City website.</p><p>-As the weather changes, adjust your watering schedule accordingly.</p><p>-Aerate your lawn to increase the amount of water the ground soaks in. This is best done in the spring or fall.</p><p>-Water your lawn separately from other landscaped areas.</p><p>-Invest in a smart controller.</p><p>-Place mulch in planting beds to reduce evaporation. This also reduces weeds.</p><p>-Leave small grass clippings on the lawn as a nutrient source.</p><p>-Fertilize lawn in the late fall with a slow release fertilizer. Do not over fertilize.</p><p>-Use hardscape or xeriscape landscaping that requires less water.</p><p>-Plant drought resistant trees and plants. Ask a local nursery about Utah-friendly landscape materials.</p><p>-Control weeds. Weeds use a lot of water.</p><p>-Increase the mowing height of your lawn mower. Longer grass grows deeper roots, uses less water and stands the stresses of hot dry weather better.</p><p>-Clean driveways, patios and decks with a broom or blower instead of a hose.</p><p>The following web sites will give you more information on water conservation:</p><p>http://extension.usu.edu/files/natrpubs/nrwq03.pdf</p><p>www.conservewater.utah.gov</p><p>www.slowtheflow.org</p><p>Reviewed by Water Division Manager</p><p>Reviewed by Public Works Director</p><p>Tips to Save Energy</p><p>-Install a programmable thermostat.</p><p>-Use LED light bulbs with the ENERGY STAR label.</p><p>-Air dry dishes instead of using your dishwasher drying cycle.</p><p>-Turn off your computer and monitor when not in use.</p><p>-Plug home electronics, such as TVs and DVD players, into power strips and turn the power strips off when not in use.</p><p>-Lower the thermostat on your hot water heater to 120˚ F.</p><p>-Take short showers instead of baths.</p><p>-Wash only full loads of dishes and clothes.</p><p>-Drive sensibly.
