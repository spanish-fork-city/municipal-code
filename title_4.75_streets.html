Post FAQs on the Streets and Storm Water Questions and Requests Website.</p><p>Who is responsible for repairing the driveway over the gutter?</p><p>The homeowner is responsible for all driveway repairs. Driveway repairs between the sidewalk and the street require an Excavation Permit.</p><p>Who is responsible for sidewalk repair?</p><p>The City. Repairs are prioritized and repaired as budgets allow. See online Sidewalk and Gutter Repair Request Form.</p><p>When will my street be swept?</p><p>Streets are swept at least twice a year. See the online Street Sweeping Request Form.</p><p>When will my road be fixed?</p><p>We try to do maintenance on each road every 7 to 10 years. Potholes are addressed weekly. See the online Street Repair Request Form.</p><p>How do I report a damaged sign?</p><p>See the online Street Sign Repair Request Form.</p><p>How do I request a stop sign, signal or other sign?</p><p>Signs can only be installed if a warrant study shows they are needed. See the online Traffic Sign or Traffic Signal Request Form.</p><p>How do I report a street light that is out?</p><p>See the online Street Light Repair Request Form.</p><p>How do I request a street light?</p><p>See the online Traffic Signal Request Form.</p><p>Something is blocking the visibility of a sign.</p><p>For vegetation see the online Traffic Sign or Tree Trimming Request Form. For all other issues call (801) 804-4550 Extension 3.</p><p>Why is my new road being sealed?</p><p>Sealing new pavement protects it from sun and water deterioration. Studies show that for every $1 spent doing this $9 is saved in future maintenance costs. The city began sealing new pavement more than 10 years ago. This has made it possible for us to have such good quality pavement even though gas tax funds are very limited.</p><p>Electric/hybrid and more fuel efficient vehicles have reduced fuel consumption and reduced gas tax money per vehicle significantly. This has occurred at the same time that we have seen heavy increases to the costs of road maintenance.</p><p>Approved 6/30/2021</p></section><section><h3 id="4_75_200">4.75.200 Address And Street Name Or Address Change Procedure</h3><p>Notify the following when there is a property address or street name or street address change:</p><p>Spanish Fork Post Office</p><p>Leslee Adamson</p><p>(801) 794-1197</p><p>leslee.n.adamson@usps.gov</p><p>CenturyLink</p><p>Korby Whiting</p><p>(801) 356-6977</p><p>korby.whiting@centurylink.com</p><p>Questar</p><p>Gwen Monson</p><p>(801) 324-3731</p><p>Gwen.Monson@questar.com</p><p>Spanish Fork Utilities</p><p>Cindy Stone</p><p>(801) 804-4506</p><p>cstone@spanishfork.org</p><p>Utah County Assessor’s Office</p><p>Clarissa Reeve</p><p>(801) 851-8287</p><p>clarissr@utah.gov</p><p>Utah County Roads and Addresses</p><p>Marye Jane Kiser</p><p>(801) 851-8644</p><p>maryek@utah.gov</p><p>Utah County Assessor’s Office</p><p>Nancy Waugh</p><p>(801) 851-8224</p><p>nancyw.ucadm@state.ut.us</p><p>Utah Valley 911</p><p>Noreen Stone</p><p>(801) 794-3942</p><p>nstone@utahvalley911.org</p><p>Spanish Fork Business Licensing</p><p>Kim Brenneman</p><p>(801) 804-4580</p><p>kbrenneman@spanishfork.org</p><p>Approved June 24, 2019</p></section><section><h3 id="4_75_260">4.75.260 Chip Seal Procedure</h3><p>Preparation:</p><p>Clean and dry areas where materials are to be applied.</p><p>Apply temporary covers to manholes and catch basins, as needed, to prevent oil and materials from getting inside of them.</p><p>Process:</p><p>Apply emulsion at recommended rate.</p><p>Spread chips closely behind emulsion distributor, slowly such that the chips do not roll when they hit the surface.</p><p>Roll chips.
