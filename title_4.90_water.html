Water taken from the pressurized irrigation hydrant fill stations at 50 East 400 North, 2500 East Canyon Road, and 200 East 400 South require a permit. These fill stations are clearly labeled “Irrigation Water Fill Stations-Permit Required”. They are only in use during the pressurized irrigation watering season. No other locations are authorized for filling tanks from the City pressurized irrigation system. An unauthorized hydrant use fee, as established in the annual City budget, shall be charged for anyone who uses a hydrant without a permit in hand.</p><p>A fee shall be paid with each permit, as established by the annual City budget. Permits shall be valid until the pressurized irrigation watering season is over. A permit must be in possession of any persons operating hydrants at fill stations. Water taken from fill station hydrants may not be used outside of City boundaries unless the water is for a City project or as approved by the Public Works Director.</p><p>Fire Hydrants. A permit and meter assembly must be obtained from the City before water may be taken from a fire hydrant. Anyone who operates a fire hydrant must have a permit in hand and be listed on the permit as trained by the City in the safe operation of fire hydrants. An unauthorized hydrant use fee, as established in the annual City budget, shall be charged for anyone who uses a hydrant without a permit in hand.</p><p>Permits to use water from fire hydrants will only be granted for specified hydrant(s). Operators authorized by the permit must protect the City water system from contamination by air gap backflow prevention.</p><p>Meter assembly may not be left on the fire hydrant overnight. Water taken from fire hydrants may not be used outside of City boundaries unless it is for a City project, or as approved by the Public Works Director.</p><p>A fee and deposit shall be paid with each permit. A utility account shall be established for each permittee and the 2 inch water meter base rate and Tier II usage rate shall be billed monthly unless water is used outside the City limits for a non-City project. The usage rate for these permits shall be billed at the non-resident rate.</p><p>The repair cost for any damage to the meter assembly or fire hydrant shall be deducted from the deposit. If the deposit is not enough to cover usage and damage, the permit holder shall be liable for and billed for the balance.
