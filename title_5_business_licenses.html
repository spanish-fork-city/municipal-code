    <h3>5.04.010 Unlawful To Transact Business Without License</h3>
    <p>It is a Class C misdemeanor for any person to engage in or carry on any business, trade, profession, or calling within the City without first obtaining a business license when required by the ordinances of the City. Each separate business entity is required to have its own business license. A business license does not authorize the license holder to conduct business on City property or facilities. No business may be conducted on City owned property or facilities without entering a lease agreement with the City for that purpose and obtaining a business license.</p>

    <h3>5.04.100 Revocation</h3>
    <p>The issuance of a license under this Title grants only a revocable privilege to engage in business and confers no vested rights of any kind upon a licensee. The licensee agrees, as a condition of license issuance, to operate the licensed business or activity in conformity with the ordinances of the City and other applicable laws.</p>
    <p>Licenses issued under the provisions of this Title may be revoked for failure upon the part of the licensee to comply with the conditions and requirements under which said license is granted, because of illegal activities thereunder, or for the following causes:</p>
    <p>The violation of any provision in this Title;</p>
    <p>The failure to pay, when due, any administrative fee (including renewal fee), tax, charge, or penalty provided for by City ordinance or State statute;</p>
    <p>Any fraud or misrepresentation of a material fact in the procurement of the license, including falsification of any information or supporting documentation provided by the licensee with the license application;</p>
    <p>Noncompliance with building, fire, or health codes;</p>
    <p>Any conduct at the licensed premises tending to render the premises a private or public nuisance, as defined in the Spanish Fork Municipal Code, or a menace to the health, peace, or general welfare of the City or its residents;</p>
    <p>Activities, under the guise of conducting a business, that are fraudulent, deceptive, or constituting a violation of City ordinances or other applicable law;</p>
    <p>Failure of the licensee to retain the legal qualifications necessary for the license;</p>
    <p>Violation of the zoning ordinances governing the licensed business or activity, including, but not limited to, parking and landscaping requirements;</p>
    <p>Conviction of any crime related to the licensed business, after the issuance of the license;</p>
    <p>Refusal to allow City employees to make inspection of the licensed premises during the business’ operating hours.</p>
    <p>No license shall be revoked under the provisions of this Title except after notice and hearing. The hearing shall be conducted by the Community Development Director. The decision of the Director is final and non-appealable. Notice shall be given by sending a copy of the notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the applicant at the address shown on the applicant's last application for a business license. The notice shall specify the date, time, and place of the hearing and contain a brief description of the reasons why the license is subject to revocation. It is the applicant's duty to maintain a current address at all times with the city business license administrator. Notice is deemed received if notice is sent to the last address on file with the City and is returned unclaimed, unknown, moved, or for any other reason identified by the postal service. The hearing shall be held within 20 days after mailing of the notice. The applicant may appear in person or may send a representative. The applicant has a right to be represented by counsel, but has no right to be appointed counsel.</p>
    <p>Licenses revoked shall be for a period of one year, unless they are for violations of numbers 2, 4, 7, 8, or 10 of the causes set forth in paragraph B, in which event the licensee may reapply when compliance with those provisions has been met.</p>
    <p>For purposes of revoking a business license, the licensee is responsible for the acts of their employees, agents, or others acting under the license issued.</p>

    <p>The City finds that the continuation and development of cable television and communications system has great benefit and impact upon the residents of Spanish Fork City. Because of the complex and rapidly changing technology associated with cable television, the City further finds that the public convenience, safety and general welfare can best be served by establishing regulatory powers which should be vested in the City or such persons as the City shall designate. It is the City's intent to ensure that City residents receive a high-quality cable television and communications service comparable to the best offered in any community in Utah County; that any inconvenience to residents in the development, operation, and maintenance of a cable system or systems be minimized; and that the City is properly compensated for the administration of cable television and communication franchises and the use of the public facilities permitted by this Chapter. It is the intent of this Chapter to provide for the means to attain the best possible public interest in these matters, and any franchise issued pursuant to this Chapter shall be deemed to include this finding as an integral part thereof.</p>

    <p>If the license is denied or approved with qualifications, or if a notice of suspension, revocation or citation or a civil fine is imposed, the applicant or licensee may file an appeal with the City Manager, by filing notice with the City Recorder.</p>
    <p>The appeal must be filed within ten days of the date of service of the notice of any denial, qualified approval, suspension, revocation or civil fine. Upon receiving the notice of such appeal, the City Recorder shall schedule a hearing before the City Manager, which hearing shall be held within 20 days from the date of the appeal, unless such time shall be extended for good cause, provided, however, that such hearing shall not be held more than 35 days after the notice of appeal is filed with the City Recorder.</p>
    <p>The City Manager shall hold a hearing on the record and take such facts and evidence as necessary to determine whether the denial, qualified approval, suspension, revocation or civil fine was proper under the law.</p>
    <p>The burden of proof shall be on the City.</p>
    <p>After the hearing, the City Manager shall have seven working days, unless such period is extended for good cause, in which to render findings of fact and conclusions of law and make a decision as to the disposition of the appeal. The City shall cause notice of such decision to be filed with the City Recorder and mailed to the applicant or licensee.</p>
    <p>The applicant or licensee may appeal the decision of the City Manager by filing a notice of appeal and the reasons for such appeal, in writing, within seven days after the filing of notice of the City Manager’s decision with the City Recorder and the mailing of such notice to the applicant or licensee. If the City Manager’s decision upholds a suspension or revocation, the license shall be immediately suspended.</p>
    <p>If a notice of appeal is timely filed, as set forth in paragraph F, the City Council shall schedule a public hearing to consider the appeal. The standard by which the Council shall review the decision of the City Manager is whether substantial evidence exists on the record to support the City Manager’s decision.</p>
    <p>An applicant or licensee aggrieved by the Council’s decision shall be permitted to have judicial review of such decision pursuant to Rule 65(B), Utah Rules of Civil Procedure, or any other applicable ordinance, statute or rule providing for such review.</p>

    <p>Except to the extent preempted by federal or state law, as ultimately interpreted by a court of competent jurisdiction, including any appeals, every Provider must obtain a Franchise prior to constructing a Telecommunications System or providing Telecommunications Services using the Rights-of-Way, and every Provider must obtain a Franchise before constructing an Open Video System or providing Open Video Services via an Open Video System. Any Open Video System or Service shall be subject to the customer service and consumer protection provisions applicable to the Cable TV companies to the extent the City is not preempted or permitted as ultimately interpreted by a court of competent jurisdiction, including any appeals. The fact that particular Telecommunications Systems may be used for multiple purposes does not obviate the need to obtain a Franchise for other purposes. By way of illustration and not limitation, a cable operator of a cable system must obtain a cable franchise, and, should it intend to provide Telecommunications Services over the same System, must also obtain a Telecommunications Franchise.</p>

    <p>Every Provider must obtain a Site License for each Wireless Facility and Structure to be constructed or installed in the ROW. When a Provider applies for a Site License, if the Provider and the City have not already executed a Franchise Agreement, the City will provide the Provider with a copy of the City’s Standard Franchise Agreement.  The City will not issue any Site Licenses to a Provider until the Provider and the City have executed a Franchise Agreement.</p>
    <p>Before offering or providing any services pursuant to the Franchise Agreement, a Provider shall obtain any and all regulatory approvals, permits, authorizations or licenses for the offering or provision of such services from the appropriate federal, state, or local authorities, if required, and shall submit to the City, upon written request, evidence of all such approvals, permits, authorizations, or licenses.</p>
    <p>The grant of a license to a provider will not excuse the Provider from obtaining: (i) any other permit or authorization required for the privilege of transacting and carrying on a business within the City required by the ordinances and laws of the City; (ii) any other permit, agreement, or authorization required in connection with the use of property or facilities owned by third parties; or (iii) any other permit or authorization required in connection with excavating or performing other work in or along the ROW.</p>

  </section>
  <section id="5_44_030     ">
    <h3>5.44.030      Franchise Agreement Required</h3>
    <p>The City is empowered and authorized to issue nonexclusive licenses governing the installation, construction, operation, use, and maintenance of Small Wireless Facilities and Structures in the ROW, in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter.  No license will be granted until a Franchise Agreement has been entered into between the City and the Provider.</p>
    <p>The City shall enter into the Franchise Agreements with Providers on a non-discriminatory basis.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City may negotiate additional or different terms with different Providers, in the exercise of the City’s reasonable discretion, and pursuant to the City’s reserved police powers and the City’s proprietary rights in the ROW.</p>
    <p>The Franchise Agreements will be for an initial term of seven years (the “Term”).  At the end of the Term, the Franchise Agreement will continue to apply to Site Licenses granted during the Term.  The term of a Franchise Agreement may be renewed if the Provider is in compliance with the Franchise Agreement and all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, including the requirements of this Chapter.  At the expiration of the term of the Franchise Agreement, the Provider shall remove its wireless facilities from the ROW within 120 days of the expiration of the Franchise Agreement or within 120 days of the expiration of the Site License if the Site License term expires after the term of the Franchise Agreement, unless otherwise agreed to by the City.  The City will not renew Site Licenses or grant new Site License after the Term, until the City and the Provider have executed a new Franchise Agreement.</p>
    <p>Site Licenses will be for a term of five years, and will be subject to all terms and conditions of the Franchise Agreement in effect when the Site License was granted.</p>

    <p>Application Fee:  In order to offset the cost to the City to review applications, the Providers shall pay a non-refundable application fee for each application for a Site License or modification to a Site License, as set forth on the City’s consolidated fee schedule as the same may be amended from time to time.  The application fee for Collocating a Small Wireless Facility on an existing or replacement Utility Pole or Wireless Support Structure shall be $100.00 or the maximum allowed by State law, whichever is greater, per Collocation.  The application fee for installing, modifying, or replacing a Utility Pole in connection with a Permitted Use shall be $250.00 or the maximum allowed by State Law, whichever is greater, per Utility Pole.  The application fee for installing, modifying, or replacing a Utility Pole in connection with a Discretionary Use shall be $1,000.00 or the maximum allowed under State Law, whichever is greater, per Utility Pole. The application fee must be paid at the time the application is submitted to the City.</p>
    <p>Site License Fee:  In order to offset the cost to the City of inspecting and managing licensed Small Wireless Facilities, and to compensate the City for the use of the ROW, Providers shall pay an annual fee for each Site License.  The Site License Fee shall be the greater of: (i) 3.5% of all gross revenue related to the Provider’s use of ROW for Small Wireless Facilities or (ii) $250 annually for each Small Wireless Facility.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Site License Fee will be charged to a Provider to the extent that it duplicates any fees paid by such Provider under the Municipal Telecommunications License tax, pursuant to Utah Code §10-1-401 et seq.  For Small Wireless Facilities Collocated on City-owned Utility Poles, the Provider shall pay an annual fee of $50.00 or the maximum allowed by State Law, whichever is greater, per pole in addition to the Site License Fee described above.</p>
    <p>Other Fees: Providers must also pay all other applicable fees established in the Spanish Fork Municipal Code, specifically including but not limited to fees for excavation permits and business licensing.</p>

    <p>Ordinance Amendments:  If there is any inconsistency between Provider’s rights and obligations under applicable ordinances, as amended, and the Franchise Agreement, the provisions of the Franchise Agreement shall govern during its term.  Otherwise, Provider is subject to any such amendments.</p>

    <p>The type of Site License sought, e.g. Collocation of Small Wireless Facility, Collocation of Large Wireless Facility, installation of a new Utility Pole, or installation of new Wireless Support Structure.  If the Site License is for a Collocation, the application must designate the type of Structure on which the Wireless Facility will be mounted, e.g., existing Utility Pole or Wireless Support Structure, etc.</p>
    <p>The location of the proposed Wireless Facility or Structure, including the designation of the proposed ROW as Permitted or Discretionary.</p>
    <p>A scaled site plan, rendering, or photo simulation, scaled elevation view and other supporting drawings and calculations, showing the location and dimension of all improvements.  The submittal must include sufficient information to determine compliance with the standards and requirements of this Chapter, specifically including information concerning Structure height and location within the ROW, compliance with the City’s intersection and driveway sight distance standards.</p>
    <p>An industry-standard pole load analysis indicating that the Structure on which the Wireless Facilities will be mounted will safely support the load.</p>
    <p>The Community Development Department may allow a Provider to maintain on file with the Community Development Department any documentation that would otherwise be required for each individual application, such as basic Wireless Facility design documents and pole load analyses.  The Provider must update any such information as necessary to keep it current.</p>
    <p>If a Provider desires to be exempted from the Site License Fee, the Provider must submit evidence that the Provider is subject to the Municipal Telecommunications License Tax pursuant to Utah Code §10-1-401 et seq. and has a valid franchise agreement with the City as a telecommunications provider.</p>
    <p>The City may require the applicant to submit additional information for any application for a Site License for a Discretionary Use.</p>
    <p>A Provider may submit a consolidated application for the Collocation of up to 25 Small Wireless Facilities, so long as the Small Wireless Facilities are substantially the same type, and proposed for Collocation on substantially the same types of Structures.  A Provider may submit a consolidated application for the installation, modification, or replacement of up to 25 Structures.  In any 30-day period, a Provider may not file more than (i) one consolidated application, or (ii) multiple applications that collectively seek Site Licenses for a combined total of more than 25 Small Wireless Facilities and Structures.</p>
    <p>Within 30 days after the date an application is submitted to the City, the City shall determine whether the application is complete, and shall notify the Provider of that determination in writing.  If the City determines that an application is incomplete, the City shall specifically identify the missing information in the written notification.  The processing deadline will be tolled from the date when the City sends the written notification until the date when the Provider submits the missing information.  If the Provider does not submit the missing information within 90 days after the date of the written notification, the application will expire.</p>
    <p>The City shall approve or deny applications in accordance with the following deadlines:</p>
    <p>Applications for the Collocation of Small Wireless Facilities shall be approved or denied within 60 days after the day when the City receives a complete application.  The City may extend the deadline by a single additional period of 10 business days by sending the applicant written notice of the extension before the applicable deadline.</p>
    <p>Applications for new, modified, or replacement Utility Poles shall be approved or denied within 90 days after the day when the City receives a complete application.  The City may extend the deadline by a single additional period of 10 business days by sending the applicant written notice of the extension before the applicable deadline.</p>
    <p>If the City denies an application, the City shall provide the applicant with a written decision that documents the basis for the denial, and shall send that decision to the applicant simultaneously with the denial of the application.  If the City denies an application for one or more Utility Poles, or one or more Small Wireless Facilities in a consolidated application, the City shall not use that denial as a basis to delay the application process for any other Utility Pole or Small Wireless Facility in the same consolidated application.</p>
    <p>Within 30 days after the day on which the City denies an application, the applicant may cure the deficiencies noted in the original denial and resubmit the application without paying another application fee.  The City shall approve or deny the resubmitted application within 30 days of receipt, and shall limit its review to the deficiencies noted in the original denial unless the applicant has changed another portion of the application.</p>
    <p>A site License will expire 120 days after approval if the licensed Small Wireless Facility or Utility Pole is not installed and operational.  The foregoing deadline will be tolled for any period of time during which an event of force majeure prohibits timely completion.</p>
    <p>A denial of a site license application may be appealed to the City Manager by giving written notice to the City Recorder within 15 days of the denial.  A hearing will be scheduled within 45 days of receipt of the notice.  A decision will be rendered within 30 days after the hearing, unless the parties stipulate to a longer time.  The decision of the Manager is final and non-appealable.</p>

  <section id="5_44_020     ">
    <h3>5.44.020      License and Other Requirements for Use of the Rights-of-Way</h3>
    <p>Every Provider must obtain a Site License for each Wireless Facility and Structure to be constructed or installed in the ROW. When a Provider applies for a Site License, if the Provider and the City have not already executed a Franchise Agreement, the City will provide the Provider with a copy of the City’s Standard Franchise Agreement.  The City will not issue any Site Licenses to a Provider until the Provider and the City have executed a Franchise Agreement.</p>
    <p>Before offering or providing any services pursuant to the Franchise Agreement, a Provider shall obtain any and all regulatory approvals, permits, authorizations or licenses for the offering or provision of such services from the appropriate federal, state, or local authorities, if required, and shall submit to the City, upon written request, evidence of all such approvals, permits, authorizations, or licenses.</p>
    <p>The grant of a license to a provider will not excuse the Provider from obtaining: (i) any other permit or authorization required for the privilege of transacting and carrying on a business within the City required by the ordinances and laws of the City; (ii) any other permit, agreement, or authorization required in connection with the use of property or facilities owned by third parties; or (iii) any other permit or authorization required in connection with excavating or performing other work in or along the ROW.</p>
    <p>The City will not grant licenses for the installation of Large Wireless Facilities in the ROW.</p>
    <p>A Provider may not install a new Utility Pole in a ROW without the City’s discretionary, nondiscriminatory, and written consent if the ROW is adjacent to a street or thoroughfare that is (1) not more than 60 feet wide as depicted in the recorded plat records, and (2) adjacent to residential residences, or undeveloped land that is designated for residential use by zoning, comprehensive general plan, or deed restrictions.</p>
    <p>A license granted hereunder will not convey title, equitable or legal, in the ROW.  A license is only a right to occupy ROW on a nonexclusive basis for the limited purposes and for the limited period stated in the license; the right may not be subdivided, assigned, or subleased except as may be expressly provided in a Franchise Agreement.</p>
    <p>A Provider’s use of the ROW pursuant to a license granted hereunder, shall be subject to the prior and continuing right of the City to use any and all parts of the ROW exclusively or concurrently with any other person or entity, and shall be further subject to all deeds, easements, dedications, conditions, covenants, restrictions, encumbrances, and claims of title of record which may affect the ROW.</p>

    <h3>5.44.030      Franchise Agreement Required</h3>
    <p>The City is empowered and authorized to issue nonexclusive licenses governing the installation, construction, operation, use, and maintenance of Small Wireless Facilities and Structures in the ROW, in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter.  No license will be granted until a Franchise Agreement has been entered into between the City and the Provider.</p>
    <p>The City shall enter into the Franchise Agreements with Providers on a non-discriminatory basis.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City may negotiate additional or different terms with different Providers, in the exercise of the City’s reasonable discretion, and pursuant to the City’s reserved police powers and the City’s proprietary rights in the ROW.</p>
    <p>The Franchise Agreements will be for an initial term of seven years (the “Term”).  At the end of the Term, the Franchise Agreement will continue to apply to Site Licenses granted during the Term.  The term of a Franchise Agreement may be renewed if the Provider is in compliance with the Franchise Agreement and all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, including the requirements of this Chapter.  At the expiration of the term of the Franchise Agreement, the Provider shall remove its wireless facilities from the ROW within 120 days of the expiration of the Franchise Agreement or within 120 days of the expiration of the Site License if the Site License term expires after the term of the Franchise Agreement, unless otherwise agreed to by the City.  The City will not renew Site Licenses or grant new Site License after the Term, until the City and the Provider have executed a new Franchise Agreement.</p>
    <p>Site Licenses will be for a term of five years, and will be subject to all terms and conditions of the Franchise Agreement in effect when the Site License was granted.</p>
    <p>Compensation:  The Franchise Agreement will require the Provider to pay fair and reasonable compensation to the City for (i) the administration expenses associated with entry into the Franchise Agreement and individual Site Licenses, (ii) the Provider’s use of ROW, including the City’s expenses associated with maintenance and management of the Provider’s use of ROW, and (iii) other applicable fees.  Specifically, Providers must pay the following fees:</p>
    <p>Application Fee:  In order to offset the cost to the City to review applications, the Providers shall pay a non-refundable application fee for each application for a Site License or modification to a Site License, as set forth on the City’s consolidated fee schedule as the same may be amended from time to time.  The application fee for Collocating a Small Wireless Facility on an existing or replacement Utility Pole or Wireless Support Structure shall be $100.00 or the maximum allowed by State law, whichever is greater, per Collocation.  The application fee for installing, modifying, or replacing a Utility Pole in connection with a Permitted Use shall be $250.00 or the maximum allowed by State Law, whichever is greater, per Utility Pole.  The application fee for installing, modifying, or replacing a Utility Pole in connection with a Discretionary Use shall be $1,000.00 or the maximum allowed under State Law, whichever is greater, per Utility Pole. The application fee must be paid at the time the application is submitted to the City.</p>
    <p>Site License Fee:  In order to offset the cost to the City of inspecting and managing licensed Small Wireless Facilities, and to compensate the City for the use of the ROW, Providers shall pay an annual fee for each Site License.  The Site License Fee shall be the greater of: (i) 3.5% of all gross revenue related to the Provider’s use of ROW for Small Wireless Facilities or (ii) $250 annually for each Small Wireless Facility.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Site License Fee will be charged to a Provider to the extent that it duplicates any fees paid by such Provider under the Municipal Telecommunications License tax, pursuant to Utah Code §10-1-401 et seq.  For Small Wireless Facilities Collocated on City-owned Utility Poles, the Provider shall pay an annual fee of $50.00 or the maximum allowed by State Law, whichever is greater, per pole in addition to the Site License Fee described above.</p>
    <p>Other Fees: Providers must also pay all other applicable fees established in the Spanish Fork Municipal Code, specifically including but not limited to fees for excavation permits and business licensing.</p>
    <p>Insurance, Indemnity, and Security:  Prior to the execution of the Franchise Agreement, a Provider must provide the City a certificate of insurance showing proof of the insurance coverage required by the Franchise Agreement.  A Provider shall also indemnify the City as set forth in the Franchise Agreement.</p>
    <p>Ordinance Amendments:  If there is any inconsistency between Provider’s rights and obligations under applicable ordinances, as amended, and the Franchise Agreement, the provisions of the Franchise Agreement shall govern during its term.  Otherwise, Provider is subject to any such amendments.</p>

    <p>The type of Site License sought, e.g. Collocation of Small Wireless Facility, Collocation of Large Wireless Facility, installation of a new Utility Pole, or installation of new Wireless Support Structure.  If the Site License is for a Collocation, the application must designate the type of Structure on which the Wireless Facility will be mounted, e.g., existing Utility Pole or Wireless Support Structure, etc.</p>
    <p>The location of the proposed Wireless Facility or Structure, including the designation of the proposed ROW as Permitted or Discretionary.</p>
    <p>A scaled site plan, rendering, or photo simulation, scaled elevation view and other supporting drawings and calculations, showing the location and dimension of all improvements.  The submittal must include sufficient information to determine compliance with the standards and requirements of this Chapter, specifically including information concerning Structure height and location within the ROW, compliance with the City’s intersection and driveway sight distance standards.</p>
    <p>An industry-standard pole load analysis indicating that the Structure on which the Wireless Facilities will be mounted will safely support the load.</p>
    <p>The Community Development Department may allow a Provider to maintain on file with the Community Development Department any documentation that would otherwise be required for each individual application, such as basic Wireless Facility design documents and pole load analyses.  The Provider must update any such information as necessary to keep it current.</p>
    <p>If a Provider desires to be exempted from the Site License Fee, the Provider must submit evidence that the Provider is subject to the Municipal Telecommunications License Tax pursuant to Utah Code §10-1-401 et seq. and has a valid franchise agreement with the City as a telecommunications provider.</p>
    <p>The City may require the applicant to submit additional information for any application for a Site License for a Discretionary Use.</p>
    <p>A Provider may submit a consolidated application for the Collocation of up to 25 Small Wireless Facilities, so long as the Small Wireless Facilities are substantially the same type, and proposed for Collocation on substantially the same types of Structures.  A Provider may submit a consolidated application for the installation, modification, or replacement of up to 25 Structures.  In any 30-day period, a Provider may not file more than (i) one consolidated application, or (ii) multiple applications that collectively seek Site Licenses for a combined total of more than 25 Small Wireless Facilities and Structures.</p>
    <p>Within 30 days after the date an application is submitted to the City, the City shall determine whether the application is complete, and shall notify the Provider of that determination in writing.  If the City determines that an application is incomplete, the City shall specifically identify the missing information in the written notification.  The processing deadline will be tolled from the date when the City sends the written notification until the date when the Provider submits the missing information.  If the Provider does not submit the missing information within 90 days after the date of the written notification, the application will expire.</p>
    <p>The City shall approve or deny applications in accordance with the following deadlines:</p>
    <p>Applications for the Collocation of Small Wireless Facilities shall be approved or denied within 60 days after the day when the City receives a complete application.  The City may extend the deadline by a single additional period of 10 business days by sending the applicant written notice of the extension before the applicable deadline.</p>
    <p>Applications for new, modified, or replacement Utility Poles shall be approved or denied within 90 days after the day when the City receives a complete application.  The City may extend the deadline by a single additional period of 10 business days by sending the applicant written notice of the extension before the applicable deadline.</p>
    <p>If the City denies an application, the City shall provide the applicant with a written decision that documents the basis for the denial, and shall send that decision to the applicant simultaneously with the denial of the application.  If the City denies an application for one or more Utility Poles, or one or more Small Wireless Facilities in a consolidated application, the City shall not use that denial as a basis to delay the application process for any other Utility Pole or Small Wireless Facility in the same consolidated application.</p>
    <p>Within 30 days after the day on which the City denies an application, the applicant may cure the deficiencies noted in the original denial and resubmit the application without paying another application fee.  The City shall approve or deny the resubmitted application within 30 days of receipt, and shall limit its review to the deficiencies noted in the original denial unless the applicant has changed another portion of the application.</p>
    <p>A site License will expire 120 days after approval if the licensed Small Wireless Facility or Utility Pole is not installed and operational.  The foregoing deadline will be tolled for any period of time during which an event of force majeure prohibits timely completion.</p>
    <p>A denial of a site license application may be appealed to the City Manager by giving written notice to the City Recorder within 15 days of the denial.  A hearing will be scheduled within 45 days of receipt of the notice.  A decision will be rendered within 30 days after the hearing, unless the parties stipulate to a longer time.  The decision of the Manager is final and non-appealable.</p>
