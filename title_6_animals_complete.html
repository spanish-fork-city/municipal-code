<h3>6.20.010 Keeping Of Chickens</h3>
<p>Subject to the requirements of this chapter and any other applicable provisions of Title 6, Chapter 1, hen chickens (and no roosters) regardless of age, in the numbers set forth below, may be kept on a lot or parcel of land in any residential zone. The following applies:</p>
<p>The number of hen chickens which may be kept shall be limited based on the size of the lot or parcel as follows:</p>
<p>five thousand (5,000) square feet and larger: up to six (6).</p>
<p>less than five thousand (5,000) square feet: none.</p>
<p>The principal use on the lot or parcel shall be a single-family dwelling, duplex (minimum square footage per dwelling unit), or twin home.</p>
<p>Chickens may be kept on a non-nuisance basis strictly for familial gain from the production and consumption of eggs only and there shall be no sale or income resulting from the keeping of chickens.</p>
<p>All enclosures, pens and coops shall be located in the rear yard of the main dwelling or in an interior side yard provided all of the requirements of this chapter are met.</p>
<p>Enclosures, pens, and coops shall not be located in a corner side yard unless the side yard shall be completely fenced using site-obscuring fencing or vegetative screening, so as to prevent sight of such areas from the street or neighboring properties to the greatest degree possible.</p>
<p>Dead birds and unused eggs shall be removed within 24 hours or less and shall be properly discarded.</p>
<div class="history">(Ord. No. 11-12, Amended 09/04/2012)</div>
<h3>6.20.020 Coops And Enclosures Required</h3>
<p>To keep chickens, an enclosure, including a coop, is required, in accordance with the regulations established in this section.</p>
<p>The coop shall meet the following construction standards:</p>
<p>with solid walls on all sides, exclusive of openings for animals and access to animals;</p>
<p>with a solid roof;</p>
<p>so as to prevent intrusion, including by burrowing, from all types of rodents, vermin, and predatory animals; and</p>
<p>such that they resemble typical accessory buildings and are not unsightly.</p>
<p>The coop shall have a minimum floor area of at least two and one-half square feet per chicken.</p>
<p>If chickens are not allowed to roam within an enclosure outside the coop, the coop shall have a minimum floor area of six square feet per chicken.</p>
<p>The coop shall be structurally sound and located in a rear yard at least twenty-five feet from any neighboring residential structures and at least six feet from the primary residential structure on the property. The coop shall meet the minimum setback requirements for accessory structures within the zoning district. The coop and enclosure shall be hidden from the public view through the use of opaque fencing materials or vegetative screening. Because a corner lot technically does not include a rear yard, the owner of a corner lot may choose one of the "side" yards to function as a rear yard for the purposes of keeping chickens and locating the coop.</p>
<p>The rear yard of the residence may act as the enclosure if it is fully fenced by a sight obstructing fence at least six feet in height and anchored on the bottom to prevent chickens from getting out or potential predators from getting in through or under the fence. If the rear yard is not used as an enclosure, the enclosure must be attached to the coop, which may act as one side of the enclosure, and shall be constructed on the other sides and top with mesh wire or other similar materials and in such a manner that the chickens cannot get out, nor potential predators get in. Such an enclosure shall contain a minimum of three square feet per bird.</p>
<p>The coop and enclosure shall be maintained in a neat and sanitary condition and shall be cleaned as necessary to prevent any odor detectable at a property line. At a minimum the coop and enclosed area shall be cleaned weekly, although waste may be composted so long as the composting area meets the setback requirements that apply to the coop and prevent any odor detectable at the property line.</p>
<p>No chicken shall be permitted to roam outside the coop or enclosure.</p>
<h3>6.20.030 Food Dispensers</h3>
<p>Chicken feed shall be stored in rodent- and predator-proof containers. Water shall be available to the chickens at all times.</p>

A potbellied pig kept on residential property within the City shall be kept as a pet for personal enjoyment, and not kept or raised for breeding, sale, or human consumption.</p>
<h3>6.24.020 Requirements</h3>

<p>Any pig over four months of age shall be vaccinated by a licensed veterinarian;</p>
<p>Any pig allowed to leave the owner's premises shall be on a leash and accompanied by a responsible person.</p>
<h3>6.24.030 Permit Required</h3>
<p>A permit to keep a potbellied pig in residential zones pursuant to the terms of this ordinance is required. A person desiring to have a potbellied pig shall obtain a permit for the location where the pig is to be kept. Permits may be obtained from the animal control officer. A tag, indicating the permit has been issued, is to be attached to a collar, shoulder harness, or other means to be worn by the pig at all times. The price of the permit shall be established by resolution of the City Council, or in the annual budget.</p>
<p>Two violations of this chapter within a twelve month period shall cause the pot-bellied pig owner to lose their license. The license may be re-instated after one year, if there has been compliance with the animal laws of the City during that time. The animal control officer will notify an owner of a second violation, which notice will require the owner to remove their pot-bellied pigs from the premises and will notify them the date they can again have pot-bellied pigs on the premises, if compliance is met.</p>
