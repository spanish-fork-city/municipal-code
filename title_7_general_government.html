    <h3>7.20.040 Spanish Fork Historic Sites List</h3>
    <p>There is hereby created a Historic Sites List, which shall contain the identification of properties designated by the City Council as historic properties. The list shall contain the address of the property, photographs, if available, and a brief history of the property detailing the reasons why it has been designated as an historic property. The Commission may recommend to the City Council that historic properties be added to the Historic Sites List as a means of providing recognition to and encouraging the preservation of historic properties in the community.</p>
    <p>Criteria for designating properties to the Historic Sites List. Any district, building, structure, object, or site may be designated to the Historic Sites List if it meets all of the criteria outlined below:</p>
    <p>It is located within the official boundaries of the City.</p>
    <p>It is at least 50 years old.</p>
    <p>It retains its historic integrity, in that there are no major alterations or additions that have obscured or destroyed the significant historic features. Major alterations that would destroy the historic integrity include, but are not limited to, changes in pitch of the main roof, enlargement or enclosure of windows on the principal facades, addition of upper stories or the removal of original upper stories, covering the exterior walls with non-historic materials, moving the resource from its original location to one that is dissimilar to the original, additions which significantly detract from or obscure the original form and appearance of the house when viewed from the public way.</p>
    <p>If the property does not meet the integrity requirements outlined in this subsection 3. (a), it may still qualify for designation if it meets one of the following requirements for exceptional significance:</p>
    <p>It is directly associated with events of historic significance in the community.</p>
    <p>It is closely associated with the lives of persons who were of historic importance to the community.</p>
    <p>It exhibits significant methods of construction or materials that were used within the historic period.</p>
    <p>It has been documented according to the Utah State Historic Preservation Office standards for intensive level surveys (August 2022 version or subsequent revisions).</p>
    <p>Designation Procedures. Any person, group, or government agency may nominate a property for listing on the Historic Sites List. The nomination and listing procedures are as follows:</p>
    <p>Completed Intensive Level Survey documentation for each nominated property must be submitted to the Commission.</p>
    <p>The Commission will review and consider properly submitted nominations at its next scheduled meeting. The Commission will notify the nominating party and the property owner, in writing, one week prior to the meeting that the nomination will be considered and will place that item on the agenda posted for the meeting. The Commission may not recommend placement on the Historic Preservation list over the objection of the owner.</p>
    <p>Results of Designation to the Historic Sites List.</p>
    <p>Owners of officially designated historic sites may obtain a historic site certificate from the Commission. The certificate contains the historic name of the property, the date of designation, and signatures of the mayor and the Commission chairperson.</p>
    <p>If a historic site is to be demolished or extensively altered, efforts will be made to document its physical appearance before that action takes place.</p>
    <p>The City will delay issuing a demolition permit for thirty (30) days and will notify a member of the Commission, which will take responsibility for the documentation.</p>
    <p>Documentation will include, at minimum, exterior photographs (both black and white and color slides) of all elevations of the historic building. When possible, both exterior and interior measurements of the building will be made in order to provide an accurate floor plan drawing of the building.</p>
    <p>The demolition permit will be issued after thirty (30) days of the initial application whether or not the Commission has documented the building. The permit may be issued earlier if the Commission completes its documentation before the thirty-day deadline.</p>
    <p>The documentation will be kept in the Commission's historic site files, which are open to the public.</p>
    <p>Removal of Properties from the Historic Sites List. Properties which, in the opinion of the Commission, no longer meet the criteria for eligibility may be removed from the Historic Sites List after review and consideration by the Commission.</p>

    <h3>7.20.050 Effect Of Designation Of The Historic Sites List</h3>
    <p>Properties designated to the Historic Sites List may receive special consideration in the granting of conditional use permits in order to encourage their preservation.</p>
    <p>In the event of rehabilitation of the property, local building officials may consider waiving certain code requirements in accordance with The current International Existing Building Code , which deals with historic buildings, and must still be followed.</p>
    <p>Owners of Historic Sites may seek guidance from the Commission in applying for grants or tax credits for rehabilitating their properties.</p>
    <p>Proposed exterior work on buildings located on Historic Sites is subject to the review and approval of the Commission. The purpose of this review is to ensure the preservation of historic properties to the greatest degree possible. This review applies only to exterior work which requires a building permit, sign permit, or demolition permit. Applications for building, demolition, or sign permits shall be forwarded by the Building Inspection Department to the Historic Preservation Commission prior to their issuance. A certificate of appropriateness shall be issued by the Commission prior to the issuance of a permit for a property on the Historic Site List. The City may delay issuing a building, sign, or demolition permit for thirty (30) days and will notify a member of the Commission, which will take responsibility for the review of the application and issuance or denial of the certificate of appropriateness.</p>
    <p>Claims of Economic Hardship. The Commission may approve a Certificate of Appropriateness for Rehabilitation or Demolition of a landmark property if the owner has presented substantial evidence demonstrating that unreasonable economic hardship will result from denial of the certificate of appropriateness.</p>
    <p>Economic Hardship Criteria. In order to sustain a claim of unreasonable economic hardship, the Commission may require the owner to provide information as to whether the property is capable of producing a reasonable return for the owner.</p>
    <p>Demonstration of economic hardship by the owner shall not be based on conditions resulting from willful or negligent acts by the owner, purchasing the property for substantially more than market value at the time of purchase, failure to perform normal maintenance and repairs, failure to diligently solicit and retain tenants, or failure to provide normal tenant improvements.</p>
    <p>An applicant who has been denied any permit by the Building Official, based on the Commission's refusal to issue a Certificate of Historic Appropriateness, may appeal that decision to the City Council. The appeal must be made, in writing, within ten (10) days after the Commission's decision.</p>
    <p>Enforcement. The provisions of this section are subject to the enforcement provisions established in the Building Code adopted by the City, or the Uniform Code for Building Conservation.</p>

    <h3>7.20.060 Standards For Rehabilitation And Guidelines For Preservation And Rehabilitationn</h3>
    <p>The following standards and guidelines shall be used by the Commission in determining the historic appropriateness of any application pertaining to Spanish Fork Historic Site List properties. In approving an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness, the Commission must find that the project substantially complies with all of the following standards and guidelines that pertain to the application and that the decision is in the best interest of the City.</p>
    <p>The standards for rehabilitation are as follows:</p>
    <p>A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building and its site and environment.</p>
    <p>The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided.</p>
    <p>Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings, shall not be undertaken.</p>
    <p>Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved.</p>
    <p>Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property shall be preserved.</p>
    <p>Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence.</p>
    <p>Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible.</p>
    <p>Significant archeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken.</p>
    <p>New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment.</p>
    <p>New additions shall be undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.</p>
    <p>General Design Guidelines are as follows:</p>
    <p>Vacant buildings should be stabilized and mothballed in order to minimize further deterioration and the threat to public safety.</p>
    <p>Retain and preserve character-defining features.</p>
    <p>Avoid moving buildings whenever possible, especially to create artificial groupings of historic buildings. If buildings must be moved, the new site should be similar to the original site and the original setback and orientation of the building on the lot should be replicated.</p>
    <p>New additions should be subordinate to the original building, i.e. lower in height, attached to the rear or set back along the side, and subordinate in scale and architectural detailing.</p>
    <p>Materials should be similar to original materials.</p>
    <p>Window and door openings should be similar in size and orientation (vertical or horizontal) to the original openings and should take up about the same percentage.</p>
    <p>If replacement is necessary due to extensive deterioration, the replacement materials and features should match the existing material in scale, form, and detailing. Replacements and alteration should not be made without historical basis.</p>
    <p>Alterations and additions should not make major changes to, obscure, or destroy character-defining features of the building or site. New additions should be subordinate to the original buildings, i.e. attached to the rear or set back along the side, lower in height.</p>
