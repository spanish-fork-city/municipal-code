    <h3>8.20.010 Purpose, Inspection, And Notice</h3>
    <p>It is the purpose of this chapter to establish a means whereby Spanish Fork City may remove or abate or cause the removal or abatement of injurious and noxious weeds and of garbage, refuse or unsightly and deleterious objects or structures pursuant to the powers granted to it by Utah Code Annotated Title 10, Chapter 11. It is declared that any lot or parcel of property which contains weeds, objects, or structures constitute a nuisance when such weeds, objects, or structures create a fire hazard, a source of contamination or pollution of water, air or property, a danger to health, a breeding place or habitation for insects or rodents or other forms of life deleterious to human habitation or are unsightly or deleterious to their surroundings. The weeds, objects, or structures shall be abated by the owner or occupant of the property.</p>
    <p>Weed abatement compliance shall be accomplished by discing, plowing, or mowing weeds within six (6) inches of the ground. Weeds are to be maintained less than six (6) inches in height throughout the growing season. The property between the sidewalk and curb (parking strip) shall be maintained by the owner or occupant.</p>
    <p>The City may inspect properties within the city and identify those needing weed, garbage, refuse, unsightly and deleterious object abatement and then serve notice in writing upon the owner and/or occupant of such land in person or by mailing notice, postage prepaid, addressed to the owner and/or occupant at the last known post office address as indicated by the records of the Utah County Recorder. The notice shall require the owner and/or occupant, as the case may be, to abate the weeds, garbage, refuse, unsightly and deleterious objects by a specific time, which shall not be less than ten (10) days from the date of service of such notice.  One notice shall be deemed sufficient on any lot or parcel of property for the entire year.</p>

    <h3>8.20.020 Penalties</h3>
  </section>
  <section id="8_20_010">
    <h3>8.20.010 Penalties</h3>
    <p>Violations of this Chapter may be dealt with administratively with the service of a notice of administrative violation and subject to a fine or charged criminally as an infraction. Any violation of any section of this Chapter may result in the owner of the property receiving a notice of administrative violation with fines being assessed as follows:</p>
    <p>A.	$500.00 for the first offense which may be reduced to $100.00 if the weeds, garbage, refuse, unsightly and deleterious objects are abated to the Cityâ€™s satisfaction within ten (10) days after the date of notice;</p>
    <p>B.	$500.00 for the second offense which may be reduced to $300.00 if the weeds, garbage, refuse, unsightly and deleterious objects are abated to the Cityâ€™s satisfaction within ten (10) days after the date of notice; and</p>
    <p>C.	$500.00 for the third offense and every offense thereafter.</p>
    <p>If an alleged violator wants to challenge the violation or otherwise does not want to resolve the matter administratively, they shall receive a citation to court.</p>

    <h3>8.20.030 Abatement By City</h3>
    <p>If any owner and/or occupant of land described in the notice issued pursuant to Section 8.20.010 shall fail or neglect to eradicate or destroy and remove weeds, garbage, refuse, or unsightly and deleterious objects, in accordance with such notice, the City may cause such weeds, garbage, refuse, or unsightly and deleterious objects to be removed or destroyed. The City shall comply with the provisions of Utah Code Annotated Title 10, Chapter 11 in recovering abatement costs. Both the owner and occupant shall be responsible and liable for the costs incurred by the City in cleaning up the property.</p>

  <section id="8_20_040">
    <h3>8.20.040 Right To Hearing And Appeal</h3>
    <p>A property owner or property occupant shall have the right to request a hearing to contest the amount owed to the City for the abatement conducted by the City to remove any weeds, garbage, refuse or unsightly and deleterious objects. A written request for a hearing must be filed by the property owner or the property occupant with the Police Department within twenty (20) business days of the postmark date of mailing of the bill for the abatement payment. The bill for abatement shall be considered satisfied if sent by regular mail to the last known address according to the records of the county recorder of the property owner or the property occupant. The request for a hearing shall include the property owner or the property occupant's name, address, telephone number, and a statement of the reasons for disputing the amount of the bill. A timely request for hearing shall stay the collection fo the bill until the hearing is decided. The City's bill for the required abatement shall be considered final if the property owner or the property occupant fails to request a hearing within the time period set forth above.</p>
    <p>The Police Chief or a designee shall conduct hearings requested by property owners or property occupants and shall affirm, modify, or vacate the bill for the City's abatement after considering all of the evidence presented. Hearings shall be conducted informally. Formal rules of evidence and court procedure shall not apply. Because the hearings are administrative in nature, hearsay is admissible, but evidence must have some probative weight and reliability to be admitted.</p>
    <p>A property owner or a property occupant may appeal the decision of the hearing officer to the City Council by filing a written request for a hearing with the City Recorder within ten (10) business days of the decision rendered in the initial hearing. If no request for an appeal hearing is made within the ten-day period, the decision rendered in the initial hearing shall be considered final. The appeal hearing shall be in a public meeting. The City Council shall affirm, reserve, or modify the decision rendered in the initial hearing and the action taken in the appeal hearing shall be final.</p>

    <h3>8.32.030 Definitions</h3>
    <p>Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable applications.</p>
    <p>"Base Flood" means the flood having a one percent chance of being equalled or exceeded in any given year.</p>
    <p>"Development" means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations located within the area of special flood hazard.</p>
    <p>"Flood" or "Flooding" means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:</p>
    <p>The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or</p>
    <p>The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source.</p>
    <p>"Mobile Home" means a structure that is transportable in one or more sections, built on a permanent chassis, and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. It does not include recreational vehicles or travel trailers.</p>
    <p>"Structure" means a walled and roofed building or mobile home that is principally above ground.</p>
    <p>"Substantial Improvement"</p>
    <p>"Substantial improvement" means any repair, reconstruction or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure either:</p>
    <p>Before the improvement or repair is started; or</p>
    <p>If the structure has been damaged, and is being restored, before the damage occurred. For the purpose of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure.</p>

    <p>Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions; or</p>
