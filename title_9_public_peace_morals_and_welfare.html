    <h3>9.32.030 Classifications</h3>
    <p>The creation of noise within the City generally may be classified under one of three headings:</p>
    <p>Sounds of commerce and industry: In this category are those noises necessarily made by commercial vehicles in process of transporting persons or goods, necessary noises of construction or demolition and other sounds necessarily connected with the carrying on of modern business life. Enforcement agencies of the City are hereby specifically authorized to work with the producers of this type of noise to either eliminate, modify and/or muffle such sounds in a way that will allow progress to continue while minimizing the disturbing effects of the noise. Such noises, when they reach such a stage that they become harmful or disturbing, are declared to be a public nuisance and shall be abated. Refusal to modify excessive noise is a violation of this chapter.</p>
    <p>Public disturbance noises: In this category are those noises which because of their intensity, the decibel level, the constancy of the noise or proximity to residences, businesses and generally inhabited areas, create a disturbance to human life and efficiency. Included in this category and typical thereof, though not exclusive of others not so listed, would be the following:</p>
    <p>inadequately or defectively muffled vehicles, engines and motors;</p>
    <p>loud machinery and pneumatic apparatus;</p>
    <p>amplified music or other amplified sounds;</p>
    <p>miscellaneous noises, including those of machinery, gunfire, etc., when their emission creates a public disturbance, either because of the intensity, or disturbing nature and/or the time of the emission. Noises of these categories are a violation of this chapter and are further determined to be a nuisance which may be abated by the proper authorities in the City.</p>
    <p>Intentionally caused noises: In this category are those noises which are caused for the sake of making noise without regard to the comfort, sleep, or general health and welfare of other persons. Production of such noise is unlawful and constitutes a misdemeanor. Typical of these type of noises are the following:</p>
    <p>improperly muffled vehicle engines, when the same are rapidly accelerated or decelerated, and especially during such hours that they are likely to interfere with the sleep or peaceful calm of residential neighborhoods;</p>
    <p>sounds that are mechanically, pneumatically or electronically produced or amplified, when the same are not enclosed within a building or enclosure which absorbs the sound, so as not to disturb the surrounding area;</p>
    <p>sounds or music created or amplified within a public building or enclosure with such volume and intensity that the sound produced is actually or potentially dangerous to hearers within the enclosure.</p>

  <section id="9_32_040">
    <h3>9.32.040 Noise Measurement Procedures</h3>
    <p>It is the intent of the city council to incorporate into the noise ordinance those standards of measurement hereinafter set forth, which will take into account the latest scientific advances in noise measurement and control while at the same time, preserving the common sense and common law determination of what constitutes a disturbance or public nuisance. Therefore, sound level measurements, while universally desirable, shall not be required to demonstrate violation of this chapter if other evidence or testimony establishes the creation of a disturbance or public nuisance.</p>
    <p>It is the intention that each separate provision of this chapter shall be deemed independent of all other provisions therein, and if any provision of this chapter be declared to be invalid, all other provisions thereof shall remain valid and enforceable.</p>
    <p>In no event shall the peak intensity of sound exceed a sound level in excess of the limits established in section 050, measured in decibels.</p>
    <p>The decibel meter or other instrument used to measure the intensity of a noise may be placed at any point on the property line (if the noise source radiates into private property) and shall be at least five (5) feet from any wall and not less than three (3) feet above the ground. If it is not possible to measure five (5) feet from a wall, five (5) dB variance will be allowed. When measurements are made inside buildings or enclosures, readings may be obtained from any area to which persons may have access. The following limits refer to the largest reading obtained, using the above procedure.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="9_32_050">
    <h3>9.32.050 Noise Limits</h3>
    <p>Noise levels shall be based on continuous noise for two minute intervals or intermittent noise which exceeds the level five or more times within a ten minute period. Noise levels shall not exceed the following limits:</p>
    <p>DAY	NIGHT</p>
    <p>Zone	6 am - 9 pm	9 pm - 6 am</p>
    <p>Residential/Agricultural	65 dB (A)	55 dB (A)</p>
    <p>Commercial	70 dB (A)	65 dB (A)</p>
    <p>(including Public Facility Zone and Professional Office Zone)</p>
    <p>Industrial	80 dB (A)	65 dB (A)</p>
    <p>When a noise source can be identified and its noise measured in more than one land use category, the limits of the most restrictive use shall apply at the boundaries between different land use categories.</p>
    <p>It shall be unlawful to sustain, in any place of public entertainment, including, but not limited to restaurants, private clubs, cafes, discotheques, or dance halls; any sound levels equal to or in excess of:</p>
    <p>One hundred five (105) dBA at any time, (if the sound level exceeds one hundred five (105) dBA at any time, a mandatory ten (10) minutes sound break at a level below eighty five (85) dBA will be taken). The restriction contained in this subparagraph is in addition to any other applicable limits stated in this chapter.</p>
    <p>Amplified noise, including music, which can be heard with the human ear at a distance of 200 feet or more from the source of the sound.</p>
    <p>Construction noise that is normally associated with building of a building or other infrastructure is limited to the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.</p>
    <p>Enforcement officials are the Community Development Director, building inspectors, and police officers.</p>

An alarm user whose alarm permit is suspended from the City shall pay a reinstatement fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00) to the City before such permit shall be reinstated. Notwithstanding the above, a fire alarm permit shall not be suspended if such an alarm is required by the building code or any statute, law, or other ordinance.</p>
    <p>Any person who uses, maintains, operates or is in control of any operational alarm system in the City while the alarm permit for such alarm system is suspended shall be guilty of a Class C Misdemeanor.</p>

    <h3>9.44.070 Right To Hearing And Appeal</h3>
    <p>An alarm user shall have the right to request a hearing to contest the imposition of any penalty under this Article including the imposition of any fee, suspension of any permit, or the determination of a false alarm. A written request for a hearing must be filed by the alarm user with the Police Department within ten (10) business days of the date of mailing of the notice of imposition of the penalty. Notice of the imposition of a penalty shall be considered satisfied if sent by regular mail to the alarm user's address listed in the alarm user's alarm information card. The request for a hearing shall include the alarm user's name, address, telephone number, and a statement of the reasons for disputing the imposition of the penalty. A timely request for a hearing shall stay the imposition of any penalty until the hearing is decided. The City's determination of a false alarm, the imposition of an administrative service fee, or suspension of a permit shall be considered final if the alarm user fails to request a hearing within the time period set forth above.</p>
    <p>The alarm coordinator shall conduct hearings requested by alarm users and shall affirm, modify, or vacate the imposition of the penalty after considering all of the evidence presented. An alarm shall be presumed to be a false alarm unless the alarm user can establish the existence of an emergency or other hazard at the time of the alarm by a preponderance of the evidence. The burden of providing the existence of an emergency shall be upon the alarm user. Hearings shall be conducted informally. Formal rules of evidence and court procedure shall not apply. Because the hearings are administrative in nature, hearsay is admissible, but evidence must have some probative weight and reliability to be admitted.</p>
    <p>An alarm user may appeal the decision of the alarm coordinator to the City Council by filing a written request for a hearing with the City Recorder within ten (10) business days of the decision rendered in the initial hearing. If no request for an appeal hearing is made within the ten day period, the decision rendered in the initial hearing shall be considered final. The appeal hearing shall be in a public meeting. The City Council shall affirm, reserve, or modify the decision rendered in the initial hearing and the action taken in the appeal hearing shall be final.</p>

    <h3>9.52.010 Purpose And Intent</h3>
    <p>It is the intent of this Chapter to enhance the public health, safety, and welfare of residents in Spanish Fork City. Camping on sidewalks, streets, parking strips, alleys, lanes, rights-of-way and in parks or other public areas is unsafe, as it obstructs pedestrian and vehicular traffic, and may place the person sleeping and public in danger of harm. In enacting this Chapter, it is not Spanish Fork City’s intent to criminalize homelessness nor violate the constitutional rights of a person experiencing homelessness. Likewise, it is not the City’s intent to prohibit the ordinary recreational use of parks and other areas open to the public such as picnicking on a blanket or resting in a park during normal park hours. Enforcement of this Chapter shall be undertaken to avoid such results.</p>
